                        Born in Kurra Chittarpur, a small village near Agra, Uttar Pradesh, my father's story began in simple surroundings. His family worked hard to make ends meet, and from a young age, he learned the value of perseverance and responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life was modest, and as a young boy, he took on responsibilities beyond his years: helping with daily chores and learning early what it meant to contribute to the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But within those simple walls, there was warmth. Laughter echoed, stories were shared, and the family found strength in togetherness. Years later, he would say: <em>"We didn't focus on what we lacked. We only knew we were together."</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His elder brother Om Prakash and his wife Beena Jain (Taiji) became his greatest teachers. She taught him to cook, to read carefully, to keep his clothes and himself presentable. She would say, <strong>"Always do your work with your whole heart."</strong> Those words became his compass.

                <p class="letter-greeting">Dear Papa,</p>
                
                <p>We are writing this at 3 AM—the sacred hour that belongs to you. While the world sleeps, you rise to feed the animals who recognize your footsteps in darkness.</p>
                
                <p>Today, as you retire after 36 years at the India Meteorological Department, we witness a miracle. The boy from Kurra Chittarpur who learned early the meaning of hard work transformed into a father who carried families, a guardian to creatures who cannot speak but know his love.</p>
                
                <p>For 30+ years, you've fed street animals every single day—through monsoons, fevers, festivals. You distribute blankets to the homeless in winter. You helped countless families during COVID with food and medicines.</p>
                
                <p>Men like you don't retire from who they are. Tomorrow you'll still wake at 3 AM. The animals will still hear your footsteps. Because service isn't something you do—it's oxygen to your soul.</p>
                
                <p class="letter-closing">Thank you for being the father who carried worlds on a bicycle. Thank you for showing us that strength doesn't roar—it rises at 3 AM and pedals through darkness. We see you now, Papa. We honor you. We love you.</p>
                
                <p class="letter-signature">
                    With all our love,<br>
