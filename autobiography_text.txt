Foreword

There are stories that need to be told. Not because they are
extraordinary in the traditional sense—no wars won, no empires built, no fortunes amassed—but because they remind us
of what truly matters. This is one of those stories.
It is the story of a man who fed stray animals for more than three
decades, who worked two jobs so his sons could attend college,
who gave blood at 1 AM for a friend’s relative, who distributed
blankets to the homeless in winter, who built a home with his
own hands and watched it collapse in the rain, then rebuilt it
again.
It is the story of silent strength. Of love expressed not through
words but through thousands of small, consistent acts. Of
sacriﬁce made without complaint, without recognition, without
expectation of return.
But more than that, it is the story of how one man’s life—lived
with integrity, compassion, and unwavering faith—shaped
the lives of everyone around him. How his example became
a template. How his values became a legacy.
I did not write this book because my father asked me to. He
iii

would never ask for such a thing. He would never seek recognition or praise. I wrote it because I realized, sitting at my
desk at 3 AM, thousands of miles from home, that I had spent
thirty-three years taking him for granted. That I had never fully
understood the weight he carried. That I had never properly
said thank you.
This book is my attempt to do that. To see him. To honor him.
To preserve his story so that others might ﬁnd in it what I found:
a reminder that the greatest heroes are often the quietest ones.If
you are reading this, you likely have someone in your life who
carries silent strength. Someone who gives without asking, who
serves without recognition, who loves without condition.
This book is for them too.
And perhaps, in reading about my father, you will see your own
father, your own mother, your own hero—and ﬁnd the words
to honor them while you still can.

Preface

It is 3:17 AM as I write this preface. The house is silent except
for the distant hum of the ceiling fan and the occasional bark of
a dog outside—one of the many my father has fed for decades.
I am sitting at my desk, thousands of miles from home, trying
to capture a life that cannot be captured, only honored.
This book began as a question: How do you thank someone who
never asked for thanks?
My father has spent his entire life giving. To animals. To
strangers. To his family. To anyone who needed help. He has
done it quietly, consistently, without fanfare or recognition.
He has never asked for anything in return.
And so, I am writing this book. Not because he asked me to—
he would never ask—but because his story deserves to be told.
Because the silent strength he embodies is rare and precious
and needs to be preserved.
This is not a biography in the traditional sense. It is a memoir—
a son’s attempt to understand his father, to honor his sacriﬁces,
to capture the essence of a life lived with extraordinary integrity.
v

I have tried to be honest. To show not just the heroism but the
humanity. The exhaustion. The moments of doubt. The times
when even he must have wondered if it was all worth it.
But I have also tried to show what I have learned: that a life of
meaning is not built in grand moments but in small, consistent
choices. That strength is not about never falling but about
always getting back up. That love is not about what you say
but about what you do, day after day, year after year.
The stories in this book are true. The conversations are reconstructed from memory and family accounts. The emotions are
real. The love is absolute.
Some names have been changed to protect privacy. Some details
have been simpliﬁed for clarity. But the essence—the truth of
who my father is—remains unchanged.
I hope that in reading this, you will see not just my father but
your own. Not just our story but yours. Not just one man’s
silent strength but the quiet heroism that exists in families
everywhere.
Because that is what this book is really about: honoring the
people who hold our worlds together, often invisibly, always
selﬂessly.
The silent strength.

Acknowledgments

To my mother, Anita Jain:
You are the foundation beneath the foundation. The strength
that held everything together when storms came. You woke
before dawn, prayed for hours, cooked for everyone, and never
once complained about the weight you carried. You fought for
our education when others said it was impossible. You taught
us discipline, values, and the importance of doing things with
our whole heart. Your own childhood was marked by loss and
separation, yet you chose to give us everything you never had—
unconditional love, presence, and security. This book honors
my father, but it also honors you. Because behind every great
father is a mother who makes greatness possible. Thank you
for being our anchor. Thank you for being our teacher. Thank
you for being our mother.
To my wife, Naincy:
You came into our family and saw my father for who he truly
is—not through the lens of a son who took him for granted,
but through fresh eyes that recognized his quiet strength
immediately. You believed this story needed to be told when
I doubted myself. You encouraged me to write at 3 AM, to dig
deeper, to ﬁnd the words I couldn’t ﬁnd alone. You read every
vii

draft, offered insights, and reminded me why this mattered.
But more than that, you showed me what it means to truly see
someone—to notice their needs before they voice them, to care
without condition, to love without expectation. In you, I see the
same quiet strength I see in my father. Thank you for being my
partner. Thank you for believing in this book. Thank you for
being you.
To my brother, Avinash, and his wife, Mahima:
Avinash, we shared a womb, a childhood, and now we share
these memories. You were there for every moment I wrote
about—the tea stall, the school drop-offs, the college decisions.
You saw the same sacriﬁces, felt the same love, and carried
the same responsibility to honor our father’s legacy. Thank
you for sharing your memories, for ﬁlling in the gaps in my
own, for being my partner in this journey of understanding
who our father truly is. And Mahima, you came into our family
and immediately understood what it meant to be part of this
legacy. You saw the values, you embraced the traditions, and
you became family in the truest sense. Your support, your
understanding, and your love have enriched our family in ways
words cannot capture. Together, you both remind me that this
story is not just mine—it belongs to all of us. Thank you for
being my family. Thank you for being part of this story.
To my father, Chandra Prakash Jain:
Thank you for everything you never asked credit for. Thank you
for the silent strength that held our world together. Thank you
for teaching us, through your example, what it means to live
viii

a life of meaning. This book is my attempt to honor you, but I
know—I know—that no book can capture what you mean to us.
No words can express the depth of our gratitude. But I hope, in
reading this, you understand: we see you. We honor you. We
love you.
To every reader who saw their own parent in these pages:
If you found your father, your mother, your hero in this story,
then this book has succeeded. Honor them while you can. Don’t
wait until it’s too late to say thank you. Because the silent
strength exists everywhere—in your home, in your family, in
the people who love you without asking for anything in return.
See them. Honor them. Become them.
This book exists because of love. The love of a father who gave
everything. The love of a mother who held everything together.
The love of a family who believed this story mattered. And the
love of readers who will carry these values forward.
May we all learn to see the silent strength around us. May we
all learn to honor it. May we all learn to become it.

Prologue

There are men who speak their love out loud—through words,
gestures, or grand declarations. And then there are men like
my father—men whose love is quiet, whose strength doesn’t
demand to be seen, yet it holds entire families and even the
smallest lives together. Every morning and evening, for more
than thirty years, my father has fed the stray animals that gather
near our home. Rain or shine, festival or fever, he never missed
a day. He speaks little to them, but they know him—the man
who shows up, the man whose kindness has no audience. That
simple act, repeated thousands of times, taught me more about
faith than any sermon ever could. It’s in that quiet consistency,
in those unnoticed gestures, that I began to see what true
strength looks like.
My father grew up with little, but he carried within him something greater than wealth—a deep belief that goodness was
its own reward. He never complained, never asked for more,
never let life’s burdens harden his heart. I used to think heroes
were loud—the ones who conquered mountains and changed
nations. Now I know the greatest hero I’ll ever know is the
man who fed hungry mouths, carried heavy loads, and smiled
through life’s storms without ever asking for applause. This
book is not about fame or fortune. It’s about a man who may
never make headlines, but who shaped lives through his quiet
1

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

faith and love.
It’s 3 AM as I write these words. The house is silent except for
the distant hum of the ceiling fan and the occasional bark of a
dog outside—one of the many my father has fed for decades.
I’m sitting at my desk, thousands of miles from home, trying
to capture a life that cannot be captured, only honored. This is
my father’s story. The Silent Strength.

Introduction

There are men who speak their love out loud—through words,
gestures, or grand declarations.
And then there are men like my father.
His love is quiet, his strength unseen, yet it has held our family—
and even the smallest lives around us—together for decades.
I began writing this book as a gift for his retirement, a way to
preserve the story of a man who asked for nothing and gave
everything. But as I gathered memories, the pages stopped
belonging only to him. They began to echo every father who has
worked in silence, every husband who has carried more than
he was ever thanked for, every son who realizes too late what
silent love looks like.
My father grew up with little but faith. He learned early that
goodness is its own reward and that complaining steals the
grace from gratitude. Through the years I saw him rise from
scarcity to stability, yet what moved me most was not what he
achieved, but how he remained unchanged—steady, generous,
sincere.
I used to think heroes were loud, men who conquered cities and
changed nations.
3

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Now I know better. The greatest hero I will ever know is the
man who feeds hungry mouths, carries heavy loads, and smiles
through life’s storms without ever asking for applause.
This book isn’t about fame or fortune. It’s about quiet endurance, faith that never faltered, and the unspoken love that
builds worlds and families alike.
If, while reading, you see a glimpse of your own father,
or remember someone who stood silently behind your every
success, then my purpose is fulﬁlled.
Because some stories don’t need to shout to be heard.
They just need to be told—with honesty, with gratitude, and
with love.

Where It All Began

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

A

tree’s strength lies in its roots—unseen, silent, but
unshakable.
We spend our lives reaching upward, stretching toward

light, growing branches that the world can see. But everything
we become, everything we can bear, everything we offer to
others—it all begins in the soil. In the place we started. In
the hands that ﬁrst held us.
Some people are born into comfort, their roots nourished by
abundance. Others push through cracked earth, ﬁghting for
every drop of water, every ray of sun. And it’s those trees—
the ones that grew despite drought, despite wind, despite
impossible odds—that stand strongest when the storms come.
My father was one of those trees.
The village that shaped him had no running water, no electricity
in most homes, no schools with proper roofs. But it had
something else—something harder to name but impossible
to forget. It had people who understood that survival required
more than strength; it required grace. It had families who knew
that poverty of pocket did not mean poverty of spirit.
In every father’s story, there is a beginning that explains
everything that follows. A place. A moment. A realization that
shapes every choice that comes after.
This is where my father’s story begins.

WHERE IT ALL BEGAN

The Village
The afternoon sun hung heavy over Kurra Chittarpur, a small
village near Agra in Uttar Pradesh, where the earth cracked
open under the weight of heat. Dust rose in slow spirals as
a thin boy walked barefoot along a narrow path that wound
between mustard ﬁelds gone dry. His shirt was faded, its collar
stiff with salt from sweat, and his hands gripped a bundle of
wood logs that felt twice his weight. He was no more than ten,
yet his steps carried the steadiness of a grown man. Every day
began and ended with the same rhythm—fetching, carrying,
helping, giving. In that village, days did not arrive with clocks or
calendars; they arrived with tasks. Morning meant water from
the well, afternoons meant gathering the dry cow-dung cakes
stacked neatly for fuel, and evenings meant cutting the leftover
stalks of mustard and lentils to light the cooking ﬁre. Smoke
from those ﬁres curled into the orange sky like quiet prayers,
and inside each hut, women cooked with their dupattas covering
their faces while men returned from the ﬁelds. Children like
my father learned that work was not a punishment; it was life’s
ﬁrst teacher.
My grandfather earned his living by selling small cosmetics—
a bindi, a bracelet, miscellaneous trinkets—from a wooden
cart that groaned under its modest weight. He was a traveling
salesman of the simplest kind, pushing his cart through the
village lanes, calling out his wares. My father and his younger
brother would walk beside him, dust swirling around their feet,
their laughter mingling with the squeak of the cart’s wheels.
When the heat grew unbearable, they would run ahead to ﬁnd
7

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

a patch of shade, wait for their father to catch up, and then
continue. That was their world—sun, dust, and duty tied
together with affection.
They had little, but somehow, nothing felt missing.
The house they lived in had mud walls and a roof that leaked
when the monsoon came. There was one room that served as
bedroom, living room, and storage space. The kitchen was in
an open balcony—just a clay chulha where my grandmother
would squat for hours, fanning ﬂames with a hand-woven fan,
her face illuminated by ﬁrelight. The bathroom was a shared
space at the end of the lane, and water had to be carried in brass
vessels from the community well.
But inside that small space, there was warmth. There was
laughter that echoed off walls. There were stories told by lantern
light, and the smell of burning wood mixed with the sound of
bullock bells and the far-off echo of temple bells.
My father once told me those nights were his favorite—nights
when the family sat close, eating simple food cooked on the very
logs he had gathered, laughing at stories that had been told a
hundred times before.
“We didn’t know we were poor,” he said, smiling. “We only
knew we were together.”

8

WHERE IT ALL BEGAN

The Teachers of His Life
Among all the people who shaped him, none left a deeper mark
than his elder brother Om Prakash and his wife, Beena Jain. Taiji,
as everyone called her, was gentle but unyielding in her belief
that every child should learn more than survival. She taught
my father how to cook, how to read carefully, how to keep his
clothes clean even when there was no running water. She would
say, “Always do your work with your whole heart.”
Those words became his compass.
She didn’t just teach him tasks; she taught him dignity. She
showed him that a person’s worth was not measured by what
they owned but by how completely they gave themselves to
each moment. When my father would return from the ﬁelds,
exhausted and covered in dust, she would sit with him and ask
about his day. Not to check if he had ﬁnished his work—but to
see him. To remind him that he mattered.
Om Prakash ji, calm and steady, was the quiet example—never
preaching, only doing. He worked long hours, but he never
complained. He carried burdens without announcing them. He
made my father believe that strength did not need a voice; it
needed patience. Together, they planted in him the values that
would become his lifelong inheritance: respect, sincerity, and
the belief that goodness is its own reward.
Sometimes, when the monsoon came and the ﬁelds turned to
mud, my father and his brother would help gather stray logs
ﬂoating in the ﬂooded gullies. They would drag them home,
9

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

laughing through the rain. The house smelled of wet earth
and smoke; the roof leaked in one corner, and someone would
always place a pot underneath to catch the rhythm of falling
drops.
To a stranger, it might have looked like struggle.
To the boy inside that house, it was contentment.

The Boy Who Never Complained
There is a question I carry with me, even now. A question I asked
my father years ago, sitting across from him at the dinner table,
watching his weathered hands break a piece of roti.
“Did you ever feel you were missing something? Did you ever
wish for an easier life?”
He paused, eyes soft with memory, and said in his gentle voice:
“I never regretted anything. Whatever I did, I did with
my whole heart.”
I have never had any regrets. Whatever I received, I did with all
my heart.
He never measured life by what he owned; he measured it by
how completely he gave himself to each moment. He didn’t
dream of greatness; he practiced goodness. Even as a child, he
believed that the only true failure is to stop trying.

10

WHERE IT ALL BEGAN

I think about that answer often. Especially now, as I sit here in
the early hours of the morning, typing these words while the
world sleeps. I think about how easy it would have been for him
to feel bitterness. To look at other children with shoes and clean
clothes and full bellies and ask, “Why not me?”
But he never did.
He looked at the wood he carried and thought, This will warm
my family.
He looked at the water he fetched and thought, This will
quench their thirst.
He looked at the ﬁelds he worked and thought, This is my
contribution.
That is the mindset of a man who would one day feed thousands
of voiceless creatures. That is the foundation of the silent
strength. I am writing this at 3:17 AM. The cursor blinks on
my screen, patient and steady, like my father waiting outside
my school in the scorching sun.
I’ve been thinking about beginnings. How every life starts
somewhere small—a village, a moment, a single choice—and
how those beginnings echo through everything that follows.
My father’s beginning was Kurra Chittarpur. Dust and heat and
a wooden cart selling cosmetics. A boy who carried ﬁrewood
and never complained.
That boy is now seventy. His hair is white, his hands are marked
with decades of labor, but his smile—his smile is exactly the
same. Gentle. Unassuming. Full of a peace that I am still
learning to understand.
11

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Tonight, as I wrote about his childhood, I realized something:
I have never once heard him speak ill of those days. Not once.
He talks about poverty the way others talk about adventure—as
something that shaped him, tested him, but never broke him.
How many of us can say that about our own hard times?
I can’t. I complain about traffic, about deadlines, about Wi-Fi
speeds. And here is my father, who walked barefoot through
cracked earth, who worked from dawn to dusk as a child, who
never had a toy or a birthday cake—and he says, I have no
regrets.
That is the man I am trying to honor with these words. But I
wonder if words are enough. When I picture him now, I don’t
see poverty or hardship.
I see a boy walking through the sunbaked ﬁelds, carrying
ﬁrewood for the family’s evening meal. I see the faint smile on
his face as he balances the bundle on his shoulder. I see faith
walking on bare feet.
That boy didn’t know the future waiting for him. He didn’t
know that the lessons written in dust and sweat would one day
build a life of quiet power. He didn’t know that thousands of
animals would one day wait for him each morning, or that his
sons would grow up and leave home and sit in distant cities,
writing about him at odd hours.
But he kept walking, step after small step, guided by something
invisible—perhaps the whisper of God, perhaps the echo of
12

WHERE IT ALL BEGAN

hope. And in that walk, under that relentless sun, the Silent
Strength was born.
Every father begins somewhere—in a village, a city, a small
apartment, a borrowed room. The location changes, but the
truth remains: fatherhood is not inherited; it is built, day by
day, choice by choice, sacriﬁce by sacriﬁce. Some men are given
easy beginnings. Others, like my father, are given only dust and
heat and the will to keep moving forward. But here is what I
have learned: the size of the beginning does not determine the
size of the man. My father started with nothing. And from that
nothing, he built everything. That is the story of every father
who ever rose before dawn, carried more than his share, and
refused to let his children inherit his struggles. This is not just
my father’s story. If you look closely, it is yours too.
***

“Every father carries a village inside him—the dust of
roads he walked as a boy, the weight of wood he carried
before his shoulders were ready, the laughter of a family
that had nothing and everything at once. That village
never leaves. It becomes the soil from which he grows
everything he will one day give to his children.”
“We measure poverty by what people lack.

But the

truest wealth I ever saw was a family sitting together
by firelight, eating food cooked on the logs a ten-yearold boy had gathered, laughing at stories told a hundred

13

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

times before.”
“A seed never sees the tree it will become, yet it pushes
upward anyway. That is faith. That is fatherhood. That
is the quiet refusal to stop growing, even when the soil is
cracked and the rain never comes.”
“He didn’t dream of greatness. He practiced goodness.
And in the end, goodness built what greatness never
could.”

14

The Boy Who Chased Sunlight

D

reams were his only possessions, but they lit the
darkest roads.

15

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

There is a particular kind of courage that comes with
having nothing to lose. When you own no safety net, no
inheritance, no guaranteed future—you either give up or you
become relentless. You wake before dawn because sleep is
a luxury you cannot afford. You work until your body aches
because rest means falling behind. You smile through pain
because complaint changes nothing.
Young men everywhere face this crossroads. The moment when
life stops being about play and starts being about survival. When
childhood ends not with a ceremony but with a realization: no
one is coming to save you. You must save yourself.
Some break under that weight. Others, like my father, are forged
by it.
The years between boyhood and manhood are where character
is tested. Where dreams meet reality, where ambition collides
with limitation, where a person discovers who they truly are—
not who they hoped to be, but who they must become.
This is the story of that testing. The years when my father
chased sunlight through impossible odds, carrying newspapers
on a bicycle, working multiple jobs, surviving an accident that
should have killed him—and through it all, never once losing
faith that tomorrow could be better than today.

16

THE BOY WHO CHASED SUNLIGHT

The Accident That Changed Everything
He was fourteen years old, in 9th class, when it happened.
It was an ordinary afternoon. School had just ended, and the
courtyard was ﬁlled with the usual chaos—boys pushing each
other, laughing, making plans. One of his friends had brought a
bike to school that day. Not a bicycle—a motorbike. It gleamed
in the afternoon sun, chrome catching light like a promise.
“Want to try?” his friend asked, grinning.
My father had never ridden a motorbike before. Never even
touched one. But he was young, and young men believe they
can do anything. He climbed on, his friend showed him the
basics—clutch, brake, throttle—and then stepped back.
“Go slow,” his friend called out.
My father nodded. He twisted the throttle. The bike lurched
forward. What happened next, he would remember for the rest
of his life.
The bike accelerated faster than he expected. He squeezed the
brakes—wrong one ﬁrst—and overcorrected. The handlebars
jerked. The bike swerved. He saw the wall approaching, tried to
turn, but momentum had already decided his fate.
The impact was immediate and brutal.
The bike crashed into the wall, and the handlebar—solid
17

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

metal—plunged into his chest. He felt it puncture through
skin, felt the sickening pressure against his ribs, and then he
was falling, the bike collapsing on top of him, and there was
blood and pain and the distant sound of someone screaming.
A gatekeeper saw it happen. He ran, shouting for help. Within
minutes, a teacher—Ramkisan Sir—rushed to the scene. He
pulled the bike off my father, saw the wound, and without
hesitation, lifted him and ran toward the road.
“Hospital,” he kept saying. “We need to get him to hospital.”
But there was no ambulance. No car. Just a rickshaw puller who
happened to be passing by. The rickshaw puller—whose name
my father never learned—stopped immediately. “Get him in,”
he said.
They rushed to Dr. Chandan Singh, one of the ﬁnest doctors
in Agra and a close friend of the family. The doctor examined
the wound, his face grave. The handlebar had punctured the
chest wall. Air was trapped in my father’s lungs. His body began
swelling—six, seven kilograms of weight gained from internal
air pressure.
For days, he lay in that hospital bed, his chest bandaged, his
breathing labored. The doctor worked tirelessly. The family
prayed.
And the rickshaw puller? He came back. Every single morning,
he appeared outside the hospital—not asking for money, not
seeking recognition. Just checking. Asking if the boy was okay.
18

THE BOY WHO CHASED SUNLIGHT

Offering to help if needed. He was a man who survived on daily
wages. Who barely had enough to feed his own family. But he
chose to care. He chose to show up.
When my father ﬁnally recovered and returned home, Taiji
said something he would never forget: “Good people exist
everywhere. Sometimes the poorest among us have the richest
hearts.”

The Years of Relentless Work
The accident taught him fragility. But what followed taught
him strength.
By the time he was sixteen, my father understood that education
was his only path forward. But education cost money—money
his family didn’t have. His elder brother was already supporting
them, and my father refused to add to that burden.
So he worked. He took on every job he could ﬁnd, no matter
how small, no matter how exhausting. While pursuing his
ITI diploma, he worked installing televisions—going house
to house, carrying equipment, climbing rooftops, connecting
antennas. It was physical, demanding work, but it paid. And
the money went directly toward his fees.
Before that, he had sold vegetable puffs and biscuits outside
schools. He would wake at 5 AM, prepare the items, stand
under the sun for hours, calling out to students. Some days
he sold well. Other days, he returned home with stale puffs and
empty pockets. But the hardest work—the work that would
19

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

deﬁne his youth—came when he started selling newspapers
and magazines.
His younger brother Bhanu Prakash, years later, would tell
me the full story. And even now, hearing it, I struggle to
comprehend the scale of his effort. Every single day, without
fail, this was my father’s routine:
3:00 AM – Wake up. The city still dark, the air cold. Get on his
bicycle.
3:00 AM to 6:00 AM – Ride 15 kilometers to Aminabad to collect
magazines—career and competition guides, entrance exam
books, general knowledge publications. Bundle them. Ride
back. Distribute them to hawkers who would go door to door.
6:00 AM to 8:00 AM – Prepare for the day. Eat. Rest. Barely.
10:00 AM to 5:00 PM – Ride 10 kilometers to Hazratganj to
collect newspapers. Stack them. Sell them. Deliver them.
Seventeen hours of work. Seven days a week. For years.
At his peak, he was handling seven different magazines, thirteen
newspapers, all distributed in bulk to hawkers. He earned 200
to 300 rupees for this work—money that meant survival. When
his younger brother Bhanu joined him, the load became slightly
easier. They worked together, cycling through the empty streets
of Agra before dawn, their bicycles heavy with paper.
But then Bhanu got a government job and moved away. My
father continued alone, staying with his elder brother in Saha20

datganj, Lucknow. He never stopped. He never complained.
And when people asked him, “Isn’t this too much? Don’t you
want to rest?”
He would smile—that same gentle smile—and say, “If I rest,
who will work?”

The Miracle on the Empty Road
Sometimes, in the midst of struggle, something inexplicable
happens. Something that cannot be explained by logic or reason.
Something that feels like the hand of God. My father doesn’t
talk about it often. But when he does, his voice becomes soft,
almost reverent.
It was December 1992. He was newly married, still working
multiple jobs, still cycling through the dark hours of the morning. One night—or rather, one early morning around 4 AM—he
and his friend Ahmad set out on a scooter to collect newspapers
from the factory.
The winter air was brutal. The cold wind slapped their faces,
turning their skin numb. The streets were completely empty—
no cars, no people, nothing but darkness and the distant glow of
streetlights. They were riding along a deserted stretch of road
when suddenly, my father saw him. An old man. Standing in
the middle of the road. Wearing a plain white kurta-pajama.
His face calm, almost serene.

21

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“Stop,” my father said to Ahmad.
Ahmad slowed the scooter. “What’s wrong?”
“That old man,” my father said, pointing ahead. “He’s in the
road.”
Ahmad looked. “What old man? There’s no one there.”
“Right there,” my father insisted. “In white.”
Ahmad stopped the scooter completely. “Jain, there’s no one.
Are you feeling okay?”
But my father could see him clearly. The old man walked toward
them, his expression kind but ﬁrm. He raised his hand—a
gesture that said stop—and spoke in a voice only my father
could hear:
“Don’t go ahead. Turn back. Go home.”
“Why?” my father asked aloud.
Ahmad stared at him. “Who are you talking to?”
The old man didn’t answer. He simply repeated: “Go back.”
Ahmad, by now, was genuinely frightened. He couldn’t see
anyone, but my father was speaking to empty air, and the
intensity in my father’s eyes was unnerving. Then, without
warning, Ahmad felt it—a sharp, stinging slap across his face.
22

THE BOY WHO CHASED SUNLIGHT

Not from my father. Not from anyone visible. Just a sudden,
searing pain.
He yelped, grabbing his cheek. “What the—”
“We’re going back,” my father said, his voice steady. “Now.”
They turned the scooter around and rode home in silence.
Ahmad was shaking, his hands trembling on the handlebars. My
father was calm—outwardly calm—but his mind was racing,
trying to process what had just happened, trying to understand
if he had imagined it all or if something truly inexplicable had
occurred.
The next morning, my father opened the newspaper with
trembling hands. He scanned the pages, his eyes searching
for something he wasn’t sure he wanted to ﬁnd. And then he
saw it. In the corner of one page, a small article that would
change how he saw everything: Brutal accident on [road name].
Truck carrying iron rods collided with scooter. One man dead.
Body unrecognizable.
The road was the exact route they had been taking. The time
of the accident: 4:15 AM. Exactly when they would have been
there. Exactly when they would have been on that road, in that
spot, facing that truck, carrying those iron rods. Ahmad never
spoke about it again. My father never forgot.
Was it a hallucination brought on by exhaustion? A coincidence
that deﬁed probability? A trick of an exhausted mind desperate
for meaning? Or was it something else—something beyond
23

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

understanding, something that exists in the spaces between
what we know and what we believe?
My father believes it was grace. A moment when the invisible
became visible, when something beyond understanding intervened to protect a life that still had work to do. I don’t know
what I believe. But I know this: my father was supposed to die
that night. And he didn’t. And every day since, he has lived as if
that second chance was a gift he must honor.
I’ve read that story a hundred times, heard my father tell
it a dozen more, and every time I feel the same chill down
my spine—not because of the supernatural element, though
that’s part of it, but because of what it represents. My father
has always believed that he is here for a purpose, that his
life was spared not by accident but by design, that someone
somewhere—God, the universe, fate—decided he had more to
give. And he has spent every day since trying to honor that gift.
I think about my own life sometimes, late at night when the
house is quiet and I’m alone with my thoughts. The close calls
I’ve had. The near-misses. The moments when things could
have gone terribly wrong but didn’t. Do I live like someone
whose life was spared for a reason? Or do I take my days for
granted, scrolling through my phone, complaining about trivial
things, forgetting that every breath is a gift?
My father never forgot. From that night onward, he lived with
intention, with gratitude, with the understanding that time
is not guaranteed—so you’d better use it well. That’s why he
wakes at 4 AM to feed animals. That’s why he never turns away
24

THE BOY WHO CHASED SUNLIGHT

someone in need. That’s why, even now, at seventy, preparing
for retirement, he doesn’t rest. Because he knows: his life is
borrowed time. And borrowed time demands purpose.
Every life has moments that bend its path forever—some
chosen, some endured. We don’t always recognize them when
they happen: a conversation that changes everything, a chance
meeting that alters your course, an accident that should have
killed you but didn’t, a decision made in haste or fear or desperation that becomes the foundation of who you become. But
years later, looking back with the clarity that only time provides,
we see the pivot points. The moments when everything could
have gone differently, when the road forked and we chose one
direction over another—or perhaps the direction chose us.
For my father, that moment was a handlebar piercing his chest
at fourteen years old. It was a rickshaw puller who asked for
nothing in return, who showed up every morning just to check
if a boy he didn’t know was okay. It was an old man in white who
may or may not have been real, who appeared on an empty road
at 4 AM and saved a life that still had work to do. Those moments
taught him something essential: Life is fragile. People are kind.
And when you are given a second chance, you use it.
Not everyone learns that lesson. Some people survive tragedies
and become bitter, their hearts hardening like stone, their
vision narrowing until they can only see the world as hostile,
unfair, cruel. And maybe it is. But my father chose differently.
He saw the rickshaw puller’s kindness and decided to become
that kind of person. He saw the doctor’s dedication and chose
dedication for himself. He saw the friend who appeared in the
25

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

road—real or not—and saved his life, and he decided that if his
life was spared, it must be for a reason. He saw grace everywhere.
And so he decided to become it.
That is the difference between surviving and living. Between
bitterness and gratitude. Between a life spent taking and a
life spent giving. My father didn’t just survive his youth. He
was transformed by it. And that transformation became the
foundation of everything that followed.

***

“There is a kind of man who wakes at 3 AM and rides a
bicycle through empty streets, not because he wants to,
but because somewhere behind him there is a family that
depends on him, and he has decided—quietly, without
announcement—that he will not let them down. That
man is every father who has ever worked a job he hated,
carried a burden he never chose, and smiled through
exhaustion because his children were watching.”
“Borrowed time demands purpose. When you survive
what should have killed you, every morning becomes a
debt you owe the universe—and my father chose to repay
it in kindness, in service, in showing up when no one else
would.”
“He saw grace everywhere—in the rickshaw puller who

26

THE BOY WHO CHASED SUNLIGHT

asked for nothing, in the doctor who worked through
the night, in the stranger on the road who may not have
been a stranger at all. And so he decided to become grace
himself.”
“If I rest, who will work? That single question, asked by
a boy barely out of childhood, became the compass of a
lifetime.”

very life has moments that bend its path forever—some
chosen, some endured.

29

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

We move through our days thinking we are in control,
making plans, setting goals, imagining futures. But then
something shifts—a letter arrives, a phone call comes, a door
opens that was closed yesterday—and suddenly, everything
changes. These are the crossroads. The moments when one
version of your life ends and another begins.
For some, the crossroads come as dramatic upheavals—a
sudden loss, an unexpected opportunity, a crisis that demands
reinvention. For others, they arrive quietly, almost mundanely:
a job offer, a meeting, a yes where there could have been a no.
But make no mistake—these moments matter. They are the
hinge points on which entire lives turn.
My father reached his crossroads in his early twenties. After
years of relentless work, after surviving accidents and exhaustion and endless uncertainty, he stood at the edge of possibility.
A government job. Stability. A future he could actually plan. And
with that job came another crossroads: marriage. The joining
of two lives, two families, two sets of dreams and fears.
This is the story of how those crossroads reshaped everything.
The year was 1990.
My father was twenty-ﬁve years old. He had completed his
ITI diploma in Radio Mechanics while juggling multiple jobs—
newspaper distribution, TV installation, whatever work he
could ﬁnd. He had applied for a government position with the
Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) months earlier, but
applications were slow, and government jobs were rare. Most
30

THE CROSSROADS OF DESTINY

days, he didn’t think about it. Hope was expensive. Better to
focus on the work in front of him than dream about letters that
might never come.
But then it came.
It was an ordinary afternoon when the postman knocked on
the door. My father’s elder brother Om Prakash opened it, accepted the envelope, and saw the sender: Indian Meteorological
Department, Government of India.
He called for my father. “Jain. Letter for you.”
My father wiped his hands—he had been repairing a radio—and
took the envelope. His hands, usually steady, trembled slightly
as he tore it open.
Inside: an appointment letter.
Position: Radio Mechanic
Location: Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh
Start Date: 7th June, 1990
He read it twice. Then three times. Then he looked up at his
brother, and for a moment, neither of them spoke.
And then they smiled. A government job. Steady income.
Security. Beneﬁts. A pension. Everything he had worked for—
every 3 AM bicycle ride, every hour of exhaustion, every day of
uncertainty—had led to this single piece of paper.
Taiji, hearing the commotion, came out. “What is it?”
31

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“He got it,” Om Prakash said quietly. “He got the job.” Taiji’s
eyes ﬁlled with tears. She pulled my father into a hug—a rare
display of emotion—and whispered, “Your hard work paid off.
I always knew it would.”
My father didn’t cry. He never cried. But his voice, when he
spoke, was thick with emotion. “I won’t let you down,” he said.
“I promise.”

Lucknow and New Beginnings
When my father received his appointment letter for the Indian
Meteorological Department, he was assigned to Lucknow, Uttar
Pradesh—a city that would become his home for the rest of his
life.
Lucknow was different from Agra—larger, more urban, with
opportunities that a village boy could only have dreamed of. But
government jobs, while stable, didn’t pay much—especially not
at the entry level.
My father’s salary was modest. After rent, food, and basic
necessities, there was little left. He lived in a small room
in Sahadatganj, near his elder brother Om Prakash’s house.
The room was simple—four walls, a bed, a small space for
belongings. The walls were thin, the space cramped, but it was
his own.
But he didn’t complain.
He went to work every day, learned the systems, earned the
32

THE CROSSROADS OF DESTINY

respect of his supervisors. He was punctual, diligent, and
willing to take on tasks others avoided. Within months, he was
known as reliable—the kind of person you could count on.
He stayed in Sahadatganj, living near his elder brother, building
relationships, establishing himself. And it was there, in that
small room in Lucknow, that the next crossroads arrived.
Marriage.

The Woman Who Said Yes
Arranged marriages in India are not about romance—not at
ﬁrst, anyway. They are about families, compatibility, values.
They are about two people agreeing to build something together,
even when they barely know each other.
My father was twenty-six. His family decided it was time.
Word was sent through networks of relatives and community
members: we are looking for a bride for Chandra Prakash Jain.
Several families expressed interest. Meetings were arranged—
awkward, formal encounters where the boy and girl barely
spoke, while parents discussed dowries, expectations, and
futures.
And then my father met her. Her name was Anita. She came
from a well-off family. Her father was a medical officer with
signiﬁcant landholdings. By every material measure, she was
marrying down.
My father owned nothing. No house. No land. Modest salary.
33

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

No family wealth. But when the families met, something
unexpected happened. She didn’t care about wealth. She cared
about character. And she saw in my father something rare:
humility, sincerity, and a quiet strength that didn’t need to
announce itself.
Her father was strict, patriarchal, known for his tough personality. He had four daughters and two sons, and he ruled
his household with an iron hand. He asked my father direct,
difficult questions.
“Can you provide for her?”
“Yes, sir. Not lavishly. But honestly.”
“Will you respect her?”
“Always.”
“What do you want from this marriage?”
My father paused. Then he said, “A partner. Someone to walk
through life with. Someone I can build a future for.” Her father
studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded. The wedding
was simple. No extravagance. No grand celebration. Just family,
prayers, and vows.
And on that day, my father made a silent promise—not just to
his new wife, but to himself: I will give her a life better than the
one I had. I will make sure she never regrets this choice.

34

THE CROSSROADS OF DESTINY

When my mother moved to Lucknow after the wedding, she
found herself in a world far smaller than the one she had left.
The room my father rented was tiny—one room that served as
bedroom, living room, and storage space. The kitchen was an
open balcony with a single gas stove. The bathroom was shared
with others in the building.
There was no refrigerator. No washing machine. No television.
Just walls, a bed, and the faint hum of ceiling fans. My mother
never complained.
She came from privilege, but she didn’t demand it. She adjusted.
She cooked on that single stove, managed every domestic task
by hand, kept the room immaculate despite its size. And my
father? He watched her do all of this, and his resolve deepened.
She deserves better. And I will give it to her. He continued
his government job during the day. But at night—after my
mother had gone to sleep—he would slip out quietly, get on his
bicycle, and return to his old work: distributing newspapers
and magazines.
2:00 AM to 6:00 AM. Every single night.
He would return home exhausted, sleep for an hour, then wake
again for his government job at 8:00 AM. My mother didn’t
know. Not at ﬁrst. She wondered why he looked so tired, why he
moved slowly in the mornings. But she didn’t ask. She trusted
him. And then, one night, she woke up and found him gone. She
panicked. Checked the bathroom, the balcony—nothing. She
waited, heart pounding, until ﬁnally, at 6:30 AM, she heard the
35

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

door creak open.
My father stepped inside, his clothes dusty, his face drawn with
exhaustion.
“Where were you?” she asked, her voice tight with worry.
He hesitated. Then he told her.
She was silent for a long time. And then she said, very quietly:
“You don’t have to do this. We have enough.”
“Not yet,” my father said. “But we will.”
She never tried to stop him.

She knew that in his mind,

“enough” wasn’t about survival—it was about security. About
building a foundation strong enough that his family would never
have to worry.

The Dual Life
For nearly a year, my father lived two lives.
By day: Chandra Prakash Jain, Radio Mechanic, Indian Meteorological Department. Punctual. Professional. Respected.
By night: A man on a bicycle, racing through dark streets,
distributing papers, earning every extra rupee he could.
His colleagues never knew. His supervisors never suspected. He
36

THE CROSSROADS OF DESTINY

showed up on time, did his work ﬂawlessly, never complained.
But his body knew. The exhaustion accumulated. He lost weight.
His hands developed calluses over calluses. He moved through
his days in a fog of fatigue, sustained only by willpower and
purpose.
And then, in late 1992, my mother became pregnant. With twins.
The doctor conﬁrmed it. Two heartbeats. Two lives growing
inside her.
My father sat in the clinic, listening to the news, and felt
the weight of it settle over him. Two children. Double the
responsibility. Double the cost.
Most men would have panicked. My father simply adjusted. He
kept working both jobs. He saved every rupee. He prepared.
And on January 03, 1993, at 3:13 PM, in the middle of a heavy
rainstorm, we were born.
Me and my twin brother. Two underweight, premature babies
who would change his life forever.

***

I didn’t know any of this growing up.
I didn’t know my father worked two jobs while my mother was
pregnant. I didn’t know he cycled through the night while I
slept in her womb. I didn’t know that the foundation of my
37

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

life—the security I took for granted—was built on his sleepless
nights. I just knew he was always there. Always steady. Always
smiling. It’s only now, as an adult, writing this at 3 AM in my
own apartment, that I understand the full weight of what he
carried.
He was twenty-eight years old when we were born. Barely older
than I am now. And he was already responsible for a wife, twin
sons, and a future that felt impossibly heavy.
But he never faltered. He never complained. He never said,
“This is too much.” He just kept going. That’s what fathers
do, I suppose. They carry weight no one else sees. They make
sacriﬁces no one else knows about. They work in the shadows
so their children can live in the light. And they do it all without
asking for applause.
The crossroads come for all of us.
Sometimes they arrive as opportunities—a job, a partnership, a chance to change direction. Sometimes they arrive
as responsibilities—a marriage, a child, a commitment that
demands everything. And in those moments, we reveal who we
are.
Some people run from responsibility. They see the weight and
choose lightness. They prioritize comfort over commitment,
ease over effort. Others, like my father, lean into it. They accept
the burden. They carry it without complaint. They understand
that a meaningful life is not a comfortable life—it’s a life of
purpose. The crossroads don’t ask if you’re ready. They just
38

THE CROSSROADS OF DESTINY

arrive. And you choose.
My father chose sacriﬁce. He chose responsibility. He chose
to build a foundation, brick by brick, even when no one was
watching. And because of that choice, my brother and I never
had to make the same ones.
We grew up with stability. With education. With opportunities
our father never had.
Because he stood at the crossroads and chose us.
***

“The crossroads of a man’s life never announce themselves. They arrive as ordinary days—a letter in the mail,
a woman who says yes, a pregnancy that doubles the
weight on your shoulders. And in that moment, you
discover who you are: not the person you hoped to be,
but the person your family needs you to become.”
“He worked two jobs while she slept. He cycled through
darkness while his sons grew in her womb.

The

foundation of their future was built in hours they would
never know about, by a man who believed that love was
not a feeling but a construction—built brick by brick,
sacrifice by sacrifice, in the silence between midnight and
dawn.”

39

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“Sacrifice is not a burden carried once. It is a choice
remade every single morning when the alarm rings at
2 AM and your body begs for rest and your mind whispers
that no one would know if you stayed in bed. But you get
up anyway. Because somewhere, someone is counting on
you.”
“She never tried to stop him. She knew that in his mind,
‘enough’ wasn’t about survival—it was about security.
About building a foundation strong enough that his family
would never have to worry.”

40

Hands That Built a Life

H

is hands told stories—of labor, faith, and the quiet
pride of creation.
There is a particular poetry in a father’s hands. If you

look closely, you can read his entire life there—every job he
worked, every burden he carried, every time he reached out to
help or hold or build.

41

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Some hands are soft, pampered by ease and privilege. Others
are calloused, marked by work that never ends. Some hands
tremble with age; others remain steady through every storm.
My father’s hands were always steady.
They carried wood logs through cracked ﬁelds when he was
ten. They gripped bicycle handlebars through thousands of
pre-dawn rides. They installed television sets, distributed
newspapers, repaired radios, and built a life from almost
nothing.
And on January 28, 1993, those hands held me for the ﬁrst time.
Not just me—my twin brother too. Two tiny, fragile lives that
weighed less than two kilograms each. Two premature babies
who should not have survived but somehow did.
This is the story of what those hands carried next.

The Day We Were Born
January 28, 1993, began like any other day in Lucknow. Cool
winter air, the city waking slowly, the smell of chai brewing in
roadside stalls. My mother had been feeling discomfort for days.
Her pregnancy had been difficult—carrying twins in a body that
was slight and small. The doctors had warned: premature birth
was likely. Be prepared.
That afternoon, the discomfort became pain—sharp, urgent,
undeniable. My father was at work, ten kilometers away at
42

HANDS THAT BUILT A LIFE

the Indian Meteorological Department office. There was no
mobile phone to call him, no quick way to alert him. My aunt—
my father’s elder brother’s wife—acted fast, arranged for a
rickshaw, helped my mother down the stairs, and together
they made the slow, agonizing journey to King George Medical
College. Meanwhile, someone—a friend of my uncle’s—ran to
my father’s office to deliver the news: “Your wife. Hospital.
Now.” My father dropped everything, grabbed his bicycle,
and rode—fast, reckless, weaving through traffic, his heart
pounding louder than the wheels. By the time he reached the
hospital, my mother was already in the delivery ward.
King George Medical College was—and still is—one of the
busiest government hospitals in Uttar Pradesh. Overcrowded.
Understaffed. Patients sitting on ﬂoors, waiting for hours. The
smell of antiseptic mixing with sweat and fear. My father had
no seat. No place to wait inside. So he sat outside under a tree,
despite the rain that had started falling—cold, heavy drops that
soaked through his shirt.
He didn’t move. He just sat there, hands clasped, lips moving
in silent prayer: Please. Let them be okay. Please. Hours passed.
The rain continued. People came and went. My father stayed.
And then, at 3:13 PM, a nurse came out. “Chandra Prakash Jain?”
He stood, his legs stiff from sitting. “Your wife has delivered.
Twins. Boys.” His breath caught. “Are they—”
“They’re alive. But very small. Under two kilograms each. One
of them is in NICU.”
My father nodded. His throat was too tight to speak.
43

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

The nurse led him inside. Through the crowded hallways, past
beds crammed side by side, to a small room where my mother
lay, exhausted, her face pale but peaceful.
And in a small incubator beside her: two tiny, fragile babies.
Me. And my brother. The nurse pointed to me. “This one is
weaker. We’re keeping him on a ventilator.”
My father looked at me—at my tiny body, my thin limbs, my
chest rising and falling under the mask. And he felt something
break and rebuild inside him all at once. I will protect you. Both
of you. No matter what. He didn’t say the words out loud. But
he felt them, deep in his bones. And in that moment, his life
stopped being about him. It became about us.
The hospital told my father he could take my mother and my
brother home after two days. But me? I had to stay. I was too
weak. My lungs weren’t strong enough. The doctors weren’t
sure if I would make it. For two nights, my father stayed at the
hospital.
Not inside—there was no space, no bed for family members.
So he sat outside. Under the same tree. In the same rain
that fell relentlessly, as if the sky itself was mourning. He
didn’t sleep. He just watched the hospital entrance, waiting
for updates. Every few hours, a nurse would come out with
news—sometimes good, sometimes neutral, never terrible.
And my father would nod, thank her, and return to his spot
under the tree.
44

HANDS THAT BUILT A LIFE

People walked past him—other families, other fathers. Some
asked if he was okay. He would smile and say, “Yes. Just
waiting.”
On the second night, a security guard brought him tea.
“You’ve been here two days,” the guard said. “Go home. Rest.
We’ll call if anything happens.”
My father shook his head. “I can’t. My son is inside.”
The guard studied him for a moment. Then he nodded, understanding something that didn’t need words.
“Then I’ll bring you a blanket,” he said.
My father never forgot that kindness. A stranger who saw a
father’s vigil and chose to honor it.
On the third day, the doctor ﬁnally gave permission.
“You can take him home. But be very careful. Feed him every
two hours. Keep him warm. If his breathing worsens, bring him
back immediately.”
My father nodded, committing every word to memory. He
wrapped me in a thin blanket, held me close to his chest, and
walked out of that hospital with me in one arm and my brother
in the other—my mother walking beside him, still weak from
delivery. And as they stepped into the winter sunlight, my father
made a silent vow:
45

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

I will give them everything I never had.
Raising one newborn is hard. Raising twins—premature twins
with health complications—is a test of endurance that most
people cannot imagine.
Every two hours, day and night, we needed to be fed. My mother
would nurse one of us while my father held the other. Then they
would switch. Then burp us. Then change us. Then try to get
us to sleep. And just when they thought they could rest—two
hours later, we would cry again.
My father never slept more than an hour at a time for the ﬁrst
three months of our lives.
He still had his government job. He still showed up at 8 AM every
day, somehow managing to look alert, professional, focused.
But inside, he was running on fumes—on love and willpower
and the sheer refusal to fail. At night, when we cried, he would
pick us up, walk us around the small room, hum old songs
his mother used to sing. Sometimes we would calm down.
Sometimes we wouldn’t.
My mother, exhausted beyond words, would watch him pace
back and forth, rocking two babies at once, and she would think:
How is he still standing?
But he always was. Always standing. Always steady.
When we were two years old, both my brother and I developed
jaundice—not the mild kind that resolves with sunlight and
46

HANDS THAT BUILT A LIFE

hydration, but the severe kind that turns eyes yellow, makes
skin sickly, drains energy from small bodies until they become
shadows of themselves. My father took us to doctor after doctor,
each one prescribing medication, each one saying the same
thing: “Give it time.” But time passed, and we only got weaker.
Our small bodies, already fragile from being born premature,
seemed to be failing. And my father, watching us fade, grew
desperate.
He was a man of science, a man of reason, someone who believed
in medicine and facts and things that could be proven. He didn’t
believe in superstitions or rituals or holy men who claimed to
heal through prayers. But when medicine failed, when his sons
were fading in front of his eyes, when every day brought new
fear and every night brought new worry, he did something
he never thought he would: he went to a baba, a holy man
who claimed to heal through prayers and blessings. He didn’t
tell anyone. He was ashamed—ashamed that desperation had
driven him to this, ashamed that he was turning to something
he didn’t believe in. But he went anyway, carrying us in his
arms, hoping for a miracle, praying that maybe, just maybe,
there was something beyond medicine that could save us.
The baba performed rituals. Chanted mantras. Gave my father
sacred ash to mix in our water. My father did it all, following
every instruction, hoping against hope. But nothing changed.
We got sicker. The yellow deepened. The weakness grew.
And my father, sitting in that small room with us, realized
something that would shape him forever: there are no shortcuts.
No magic cures. Just medicine, patience, and faith—but faith
without action is empty, and hope without effort is meaningless.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

He returned to the doctors, but this time he was different. He
insisted on new tests, new treatments, new approaches. He
refused to accept “give it time” as an answer. He became a
force, relentless in his pursuit of our healing, unwilling to give
up, unable to accept that we might not make it. And slowly—
painfully slowly, day by agonizing day—we began to improve. It
took weeks. But eventually, the jaundice faded. Our eyes cleared.
Our energy returned. And my father learned a lesson he would
carry forever: Hope is not enough. Action is what saves lives.
When my brother was eight years old, something happened that
still haunts my father’s dreams.
It was Dussehra—the festival where giant effigies of Ravana are
burned to symbolize the victory of good over evil. Our housing
society had organized a big celebration in the open ﬁeld in front
of our house.
My brother was sitting on my father’s shoulders, watching the
festivities—the lights, the music, the massive wooden structure
waiting to be lit. And then, the moment arrived. The effigy
was set on ﬁre. Flames roared upward. The crowd cheered.
And someone lit a ﬁrecracker too close. The explosion was
deafening. Louder than anything my brother had ever heard.
The shockwave hit him like a physical force.
He screamed. Then went silent.
My father pulled him down, looked at his face, and saw terror—
not just fear, but complete disorientation.

48

HANDS THAT BUILT A LIFE

“Are you okay?” my father asked, gripping his shoulders.
My brother stared at him. “Who are you?”
My father’s blood went cold. “I’m your father. It’s me.”
“Where are we?” my brother said, his voice rising in panic.
“Who are you? Where are we?”
He had no memory. No recognition. Just fear.
My father didn’t hesitate. He ran—carrying my brother in his
arms, sprinting toward the car, shouting for my mother to bring
keys. They drove to the nearest hospital, breaking every speed
limit. My brother was crying the entire way, asking the same
questions over and over: “Who are you? Where am I?”
At the hospital, the doctor examined him—checked his pupils,
his reﬂexes, his hearing.
“Acute short-term memory loss,” the doctor said. “The sound
shock disrupted his neural pathways temporarily.”
“Will he recover?” my father asked, his voice barely steady.
“Most likely. But it will take time. Keep him calm. No loud
noises. Monitor him closely.”
My father nodded. He took my brother home, held him through
the night, whispered reassurances until ﬁnally—hours later—
recognition ﬂickered back into my brother’s eyes.
49

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“Papa?” he said, uncertain.
“Yes,” my father whispered, tears streaming down his face.
“Yes, I’m here.”
It took days for my brother’s memory to fully return. And in
those days, my father barely slept. He watched over him like
a sentinel, terriﬁed that if he looked away, he might lose him
again.
***
I remember none of this. Not my birth. Not the jaundice. Not
the night my brother forgot who we were. I was too young. Or I
wasn’t the one it happened to. Or my brain, mercifully, chose
not to store the trauma. But my father remembers everything.
Every hospital visit. Every sleepless night. Every moment of
fear.
And he carried it all without ever making us feel like we were
burdens. That’s the thing about fathers—especially fathers like
mine. They absorb the terror, the exhaustion, the pain. They
process it silently, carry it alone, and never let it touch their
children.
We got to be kids. Carefree. Innocent. Safe. Because he bore the
weight for us.
I think about that now, as I sit here writing at 3:42 AM. I think
about what it means to protect someone so completely that they
never even know they were in danger.
50

HANDS THAT BUILT A LIFE

That’s love, isn’t it?
Not the loud, grand gestures. But the quiet, invisible labor. The
vigils no one sees. The fears no one knows about. My father
gave us that. And I’m only now beginning to understand how
rare and precious it is.
Fatherhood is not a role you apply for. It’s a weight you accept.
Some men are ready for it. Others are not. But ready or not, the
responsibility arrives—screaming, fragile, utterly dependent—
and suddenly, your life is no longer yours. Some men resent it.
They see children as obstacles to freedom, to ambition, to the
life they wanted.
Others, like my father, see them as purpose.
He never had much. But he gave us everything.
He never slept. But we always felt rested.
He carried fear. But we only felt safety.
That’s the alchemy of parenthood—the ability to transform
your suffering into your children’s peace.
And it happens in the hours they never see. In the nights they
sleep through. In the moments they forget.
But it happens. Every single day.

51

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

***

“A father sits outside a hospital in the rain, waiting for
news about a child he has not yet held. He does not eat.
He does not sleep. He does not move. And in those hours,
something shifts inside him—the boy he was dies, and
the man his children need is born. This is how fatherhood
begins: not with joy, but with terror. Not with certainty,
but with a vow made in silence to a God he hopes is
listening.”
“To protect someone so completely that they never even
know they were in danger—that is the truest, most
invisible, most heartbreaking form of love. It is the love of
every father who swallows his fear so his children can feel
safe, who hides his exhaustion so his family can feel cared
for, who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders
and tells everyone he is fine.”
“Fatherhood is not a role you apply for. It is a weight
you accept the moment you hold your child for the first
time and realize, with terrifying clarity, that this small
life depends entirely on you.”
“His hands told stories—of labor, of faith, of the quiet
pride of creation. Every callus was a chapter, every scar a
sentence, every tremor a memory of something he carried
so his children wouldn’t have to.”

52

The Heart Finds Its Home

L

ove isn’t spoken in promises; it’s built, day after day,
in shared silence.
We speak of love as if it’s a feeling—something that

happens to you, like lightning or falling or fever. And maybe it
begins that way. Maybe it starts with attraction, with chemistry,
with the thrill of possibility.

53

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

But real love—the kind that lasts, that weathers storms, that
builds families—is not a feeling. It’s a practice. A discipline. A
choice remade every morning when you wake beside someone
and decide, once again: I am with you.
It’s in the small things. The cup of tea prepared without asking.
The shoulder offered when words fail. The patience extended
when exhaustion screams for rest.
It’s in the way a father stands under the sun, waiting for his
sons to ﬁnish school. In the way a mother teaches with ﬁrm
hands and a soft heart. In the way two people—different in so
many ways—learn to move through life as one.
This is the story of how my father and mother built a home. Not
a house—walls and roof and furniture. But a home. A place
where we felt safe, seen, and loved.
And it wasn’t built with grand gestures or romantic declarations.
It was built in the ordinary, unremarkable moments that no one
ever sees.

The Woman Who Made Him Better
My mother came from privilege, but she carried herself with
humility.
Her father—my maternal grandfather—was a medical officer
with extensive farming lands. He was known throughout his
community as a man of authority, discipline, and uncompromising standards. He had four daughters and two sons, and he
54

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

ruled his household with expectations that were absolute. My
mother was the eldest daughter. And when she was only ﬁve
years old, my grandfather made a decision that would shape
her entire life. He gave her away.
Not to strangers—to his sister. My mother’s aunt, her bua. The
reasons were never fully explained. Perhaps it was tradition.
Perhaps it was convenience. Perhaps my grandfather believed
his sister, who had no daughters of her own, deserved one. But
whatever the reason, the result was the same: my mother was
taken from her parents’ home and raised in another.
She was ﬁve years old.
Her younger sister, when offered the same arrangement, refused. She cried. She clung to her mother. And my grandfather,
moved by her distress, allowed her to stay. My mother said
nothing. She didn’t cry. She didn’t cling. She simply accepted.
Because even at ﬁve years old, she had learned that her feelings
didn’t matter as much as obedience. She grew up in her aunt’s
house. She was treated well—fed, clothed, educated. Her bua
loved her, cared for her, raised her with affection. But it wasn’t
the same. It could never be the same.
She saw her parents on occasion—visits that felt more like
formalities than reunions. She saw her siblings growing up
together, sharing jokes and memories, while she remained
apart. She learned discipline. She learned sacriﬁce. She learned
how to suppress her own needs for the sake of peace.

55

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

And she learned, above all, that love was not guaranteed—not
even from parents. That lesson hardened something in her.
Made her tough. Made her vigilant. Made her determined that
her own children would never, ever feel what she felt: the ache
of being unwanted.
When my mother married my father and moved into that one
small room in Lucknow, she could have complained. She could
have compared her new life to the spacious home she left behind,
the servants who once cooked her meals, the comfort she once
took for granted.
But she didn’t.
She rolled up her sleeves and built a life.
Every morning, she woke at 5 AM. She prepared breakfast. She
packed my father’s lunch. Then she would begin her prayers—
two hours of devotion that could not be interrupted. But we
were children. We needed to be woken. We needed to be fed. We
needed to be dressed. We needed to be ready for school.
And so, while my mother prayed, my father did something that
was, in our community, unusual: he got us ready.
Every single morning, without fail, he would wake us gently,
help us get ready, lay out our clothes, comb our hair, tie our
shoelaces, pack our school bags. And then he would take care
of every household chore that needed doing before dawn—
cleaning, tidying, making sure the house was in order—without
hesitation, without being asked, without ever suggesting that
56

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

any of it was beneath him. He did it in the early morning hours,
before he left for work, quietly, as naturally as breathing, as
if the idea of leaving these tasks for someone else had never
occurred to him. After we had eaten breakfast—prepared by my
mother before her prayers—he would drop us to school, every
single day, rain or shine, healthy or sick. He would wait until
we were safely inside, and then continue to his office.
We took this for granted. We assumed all fathers did this. We
didn’t realize how rare it was—a father handling every domestic
task without hesitation, being present in those small, mundane
moments that children never remember but that shape who they
become. Years later, when I became a father myself, I ﬁnally
understood. I understood the exhaustion of getting a child
ready in the morning. I understood the patience required to
manage a household before dawn, day after day, while holding
down a full-time job. I understood the love it takes to do these
things without resentment, without complaint, without ever
once saying: look what I do for you.
My father never spoke about it. He never made us feel guilty for
the work he put in. He just did it—quietly, consistently, with
the same gentle care he brought to everything else. And my
mother, after her prayers, would cook. She would prepare lunch
for my father, then for us. She would manage everything else—
the house, the discipline, the values. Then evening prayers.
Then dinner. Seven days a week. 365 days a year. No breaks.
No vacations. No complaints. They divided the labor not by
tradition, not by gender roles, but by necessity and love. She
prayed and cooked. He managed the rest. Together, they built a
routine that worked, and together they ensured we never felt
57

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

neglected, never felt like we were too much trouble.
She never ate outside food—not once in her entire adult life.
Not because we couldn’t afford it, but because her religious
discipline forbade it. She never saw the inside of a restaurant.
Never tasted fast food. Never indulged in the small pleasures
others took for granted.
Her life was routine, discipline, and duty.
And yet, she never seemed bitter. She had made peace with her
choices. She had accepted that her purpose was not personal
fulﬁllment—it was family.
But life, as it always does, tested them again—harder this time,
more cruelly.
When me and my brother were in the 3rd standard, my mother
was diagnosed with a tumor in her abdomen. I was too young to
understand what that word meant—tumor—but I understood
the silence that settled over our home. I understood the way my
father’s face changed when he thought we weren’t looking. I
understood the hushed conversations between my parents late
at night, the kind where voices drop so low that you can hear
only the weight of what’s being said, not the words themselves.
She needed surgery. There was no delaying it, no alternative
treatment, no second opinion that could erase the diagnosis. It
had to be done, and it had to be done soon. My father handled
everything—the hospital consultations, the paperwork, the
arrangements—with the same calm determination he brought
58

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

to everything else. If he was terriﬁed, and he must have been
terriﬁed, he didn’t let it show. Not to us. Not to my mother. He
became the steady ground beneath a family that was shaking.
But the moment that still lives inside me—the moment I carry
like a stone in my chest—came just before the operation. My
mother, lying on the hospital bed, about to be wheeled into the
operating room, looked up at my father and said something that
shattered every pretense of composure he had built. She said:
“If anything happens to me during the operation, please take
care of the children. Don’t let them feel my absence.” That was
it. That was all she said. Not “I’m scared.” Not “Tell me I’ll be
okay.” Not “Hold my hand.” Instead, even in the face of her
own mortality, her only thought was of us. Her only fear was
not death itself but the possibility that her children might grow
up without a mother’s watchfulness, without someone to guard
them from the wrong path, without someone who would ﬁght
the world for them the way she always had.
My father held her hand. He didn’t cry—not there, not in front
of her. He nodded. And in that nod was everything—a vow, a
promise, a covenant between two people who understood each
other so completely that words were almost unnecessary. He
was telling her: I will. I will take care of them. I will be both
father and mother if I have to. I will not let them fall.
The operation was successful. My mother recovered. But
something shifted in my father after that day. From that point
forward, he never let my mother lift anything heavy. He never
asked her to do the cleaning or the mopping. He took on those
tasks himself—quietly, without announcing it, without making
59

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

her feel like she was fragile or diminished. He just did it. He
managed every physically demanding household chore without
hesitation, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, as
if he hadn’t already spent the morning getting two boys ready
for school and the evening running a tea stall.
Every husband who reads this will understand that moment—
the moment when you look at your wife and realize, truly realize,
that she is not invincible. That she is human. That she needs
you in ways she will never ask for. And every wife who reads this
will understand my mother’s words—because every mother’s
last thought, in every crisis, is never about herself. It is always,
always about the children.
That is the bond between a husband and wife. Not romance. Not
passion. Not the grand declarations that ﬁll movies and novels.
But this: the quiet promise, made without words, that says I
will carry what you cannot. I will be strong when you are weak. I
will take care of what matters most to both of us. And my father
kept that promise. Every single day. For the rest of his life.
But there was one thing she insisted on, even through illness,
even through recovery. One battle she fought ﬁercely, even
when others in the family disagreed.
Our education.

60

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

The Fight for Better Schools
By the time me and my brother reached 6th standard, we
had been learning at home. My mother taught us herself—
reading, writing, math, Hindi. She was strict, uncompromising,
refusing to let us slack off even for a moment. But she knew
homeschooling had limits. She saw other children in the
neighborhood—children from wealthier families—attending
English-medium convent schools. Schools with better teachers,
better resources, better futures.
And she wanted that for us. She brought it up with my father
one evening.
“I want to put the boys in St. Thomas Convent School,” she said.
My father looked up from his dinner. “That school is expensive.”
“I know.”
“We can’t afford it right now.”
“We’ll manage,” my mother said. Her voice was calm, but there
was steel beneath it.
“It’s not just tuition,” my father said gently. “It’s uniforms,
books, transport. It’s—”
“I know what it is,” my mother interrupted. “And I’m telling
you: our sons will go to that school.”
61

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

My father studied her for a long moment. Then he nodded.
“Okay.”
That one word—okay—changed everything. My father went to
work the next day and calculated the ﬁnances. He cut expenses.
He saved more aggressively. He took on extra responsibilities
at work, hoping for incremental raises. And a few months later,
me and my brother were enrolled in St. Thomas Convent School.
We wore crisp uniforms. We carried new textbooks. We sat in
classrooms with fans and blackboards and teachers who spoke
ﬂuent English. And we had no idea how much that cost. Not
just in money—but in the extra hours my father worked, the
meals my mother stretched further, the small sacriﬁces they
made every single day.
We just knew: we were going to a good school. And our parents
were proud.

The Day We Saw Him in the Canteen
There’s a memory I carry that I wish I could forget. Not because
it’s painful, exactly—but because it revealed something I wasn’t
ready to see. We were in 7th standard. Me and my brother rode
our bicycles to school every day—about ﬁve kilometers from
our government housing colony.
One morning, we realized my father had forgotten his tiffin—
the lunchbox my mother had packed for him. She handed it to
62

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

us and said, “Drop it off at his office on your way to school.”
We nodded. It wasn’t out of the way. His office was in the
Indian Meteorological Department, right along our route. We
cycled there, locked our bikes, and walked into the building.
The security guard directed us toward the office canteen.
“He’s usually there around this time,” the guard said.
We walked through the hallway, our shoes squeaking on the
polished ﬂoor. The canteen was small—a few tables, a counter,
the smell of tea and fried snacks.
And there, behind the counter, was our father. Working. Serving
tea, managing the stall, handling every task himself—cleaning,
organizing, serving. His uniform shirt was slightly damp. His
face was focused, intent on the work.
He hadn’t seen us yet. I froze. My brother froze beside me. We
knew our father worked hard. We knew he was humble. But
this—this was different. This was our father, a government
employee, running a tea stall, doing every task himself with the
same quiet dignity he brought to everything. Then he looked
up, saw us, and smiled—not a forced smile, not an embarrassed
smile, but a genuine, warm smile, as if seeing us was the best
part of his day. “Come, come!” he said, wiping his hands
on a towel. “Sit down! I’ll get you tea and biscuits.” We sat,
numb, unsure what to say. He brought us chai—freshly made,
still steaming—and a plate of biscuits, and sat across from us,
chatting casually, asking about school, as if everything were
normal. But nothing felt normal.

63

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Later, after we left, my brother and I rode in silence for a long
time.
Finally, I said, “He runs the tea stall.”
“I know,” my brother said quietly.
We didn’t talk about it again. But we both understood: our father
was working a second job. Right there in his own office. Running
a tea stall, serving his colleagues, managing everything himself,
earning extra money.
And he did it with a smile. With dignity. With no shame. Because
shame, to him, was not in hard work. Shame was in failing to
provide. Years later, when we were adults, my father ﬁnally told
us the full story.
The tea stall wasn’t officially his. Government employees
weren’t allowed to run side businesses. So he registered it
under a friend’s name, funded it completely himself, and ran
it discreetly. Every morning, before his shift started, he would
stock the canteen—packets of biscuits, tobacco, tea powder,
snacks. During breaks, he would serve customers, handle
money, keep records. And every evening, he would count the
earnings, set aside a portion for restocking, and bring the rest
home.
“Why?” I asked him. “Your salary was enough. Why did you do
that?”
He looked at me, surprised by the question.
64

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

“Your education wasn’t going to pay for itself,” he said simply.
“And I wanted you to have everything I didn’t.”
That was it. No grand philosophy. No elaborate justiﬁcation.
Just a father doing what fathers do: carrying burdens so their
children don’t have to.
***
I think about that day often. The day we walked into that canteen
and saw our father working behind the counter. At the time, I
felt embarrassment. I felt confusion. I didn’t understand why
he needed to do that. Why he couldn’t just… stop. But now,
sitting here at 4:03 AM, writing these words, I understand.
He did it because we were in a convent school. Because we had
bicycles. Because we had books and uniforms and a future that
was brighter than his past. He did it because love is not a feeling.
It’s a practice. A discipline. A choice remade every single day.
And he never, ever made us feel like we were the reason for his
struggle. He carried it with a smile. With grace. With the quiet
strength that deﬁned everything he did.
I wish I could go back to that day. I wish I could walk into that
canteen, see him working behind the counter, and instead of
freezing in confusion, I could say:
Thank you. For this. For everything.
But I didn’t. I was too young. Too unaware.
65

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

So I’m saying it now.
Thank you, Papa. For the tea stall. For every task you did with
dignity. For the sacriﬁces I didn’t see.
***

Every family has a backbone. Someone who holds everything
together, even when it feels like everything is falling apart.
Sometimes it’s the father. Sometimes it’s the mother. Sometimes it’s both, working in tandem, each carrying what the other
cannot.
In our family, it was both.
My father carried the ﬁnancial weight. My mother carried the
emotional discipline. He worked two jobs, cycled through dark
mornings, ran a tea stall in the canteen. She woke before dawn,
prayed for hours, kept our home immaculate, fought for our
education.
Together, they built something greater than themselves. And
the truth is: we took it for granted. Every child does. We assume
our parents will always be there, always strong, always capable.
We don’t see the exhaustion they hide. We don’t know the
sacriﬁces they make. Until one day, we grow up. We have our
own struggles. We face our own exhaustion. And suddenly, we
understand.
Oh. This is what they did for us. Every single day.
66

THE HEART FINDS ITS HOME

And by then, we can only hope it’s not too late to say thank you.

***

“Every morning he handled every household chore before
dawn—ironed our uniforms, combed our hair, packed our
bags, managed everything that needed managing—and
then he went to work as if none of it had happened. That
is the secret mathematics of parenthood: the hours no
one counts, the labor no one sees, the love expressed not
in words but in pressed shirts and polished shoes and a
father standing in the sun, waiting, always waiting, with
a smile that said everything was fine.”
“Behind every good man stands a woman who challenged
him to be better—not with words, but with her own quiet
discipline, her own silent sacrifice, her own refusal to
complain. My mother and father did not divide their roles
by tradition. They divided them by love: she prayed and
cooked, he washed and carried, and together they built
something neither could have built alone.”
“The chore you do in secret feeds the dream your child
will live. The uniform you press at dawn becomes the
confidence your son carries to school. The tiffin you pack
with trembling hands becomes the memory your daughter
holds for a lifetime. Parenthood is a thousand invisible
acts, and every single one matters.”

67

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“We saw him working in that canteen and froze. We didn’t
understand then. Now I do: shame was never in the work.
Shame was in failing to provide. And my father would
have done a thousand tasks, scrubbed a million floors,
before he let his sons go without.”

68

A Life Beyond Himself

S

ome souls ﬁnd peace only in giving.
There are people who spend their lives accumulating—
wealth, possessions, status, power.

They measure

success by what they own, by the size of their homes, by the
numbers in their bank accounts. And then there are people who
measure success differently. Not by what they have, but by what
they give away.
Not by how much they’ve taken from the world, but by how
much they’ve returned to it.
These are the people who wake before dawn to feed the hungry.
Who visit the sick without being asked. Who give without
expecting recognition. Who serve not because it beneﬁts them,
but simply because it needs to be done. My father is one of those
people.
For more than thirty years—every single day, without
exception—he has fed the stray animals in our neighborhood.
Dogs, cows, cats. The forgotten creatures that most people step
over, ignore, or chase away. He doesn’t do it for applause. He
69

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

doesn’t post about it on social media. He doesn’t tell stories
about his kindness to strangers.
He just does it. Quietly. Consistently. As naturally as breathing.
This is the story of that service. And the philosophy that drives
it.

The Promise That Started Everything

It began with a conversation my father had with his own father,
decades ago. My grandfather, despite his modest means, had
always believed in giving. Every day, he would set aside a small
portion of grain to feed birds. He would leave water bowls
outside for stray dogs. He would share whatever little he had
with those who had even less.

70

A LIFE BEYOND HIMSELF

One day, when my father was still young—maybe in his early
twenties—my grandfather said something that would change
his life. “Set aside 12.5 percent of your income,” he said. “Not
for yourself. For others.” My father was earning very little at
the time. Barely enough to support himself. The idea of giving
away more than ten percent seemed impossible.
“But how will I manage?” my father asked.
My grandfather smiled. “If you give with a pure heart, it will
always come back to you. Not immediately. Not obviously. But
it will come back.” My father didn’t fully understand. But
he trusted his father. So he started. 12.5 percent of every
paycheck—no matter how small—was set aside. Not spent on
himself. Not saved. But given.
To charity. To the poor. To anyone who needed it. And slowly,
over the years, that practice evolved into something more
speciﬁc.
Feeding animals.
For the past thirty-two years, my father’s day has started the
same way: 4:00 AM, the alarm goes off, most of the city still
asleep, streets dark and empty and quiet. He gets out of bed,
washes his face, says a brief prayer, and picks up two cloth bags
ﬁlled with bread, biscuits, sometimes rotis left over from the
previous night’s dinner. He steps outside into air that is cool—
cold in winter, slightly less oppressive in summer—and the
sky is still black, stars fading as dawn approaches. And then he
walks.
71

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Not a short walk. A three-kilometer route through the neighborhood, along the main road, through narrow side lanes, past the
industrial area, around the housing colony. And everywhere he
goes, they are waiting: dogs thin and scarred and limping, cows
bony with ribs visible and eyes dull with hunger. They know
him. They recognize his footsteps, the sound of his approach,
the rhythm of his walk. And as he nears, they come—slowly at
ﬁrst, cautious, testing the air, then more eagerly as they realize
it’s him, the man who never forgets, the man who always shows
up.
He kneels on the ground, breaking bread into pieces, distributing it evenly, speaking softly to them not in commands but in
gentle, affectionate tones: “Come, come. Eat. There’s enough
for everyone.” Some dogs wag their tails, their whole bodies
shaking with joy. Some cows nuzzle his hand, their rough
tongues licking his ﬁngers. Some simply eat in silence, grateful,
their eyes saying what they cannot speak. And my father stays
until every piece of food is gone, until every animal has been
fed, until he is sure no one is left hungry.
Then he walks home, completes his morning prayers, and by
6:00 AM his “official” day begins—the day that pays the bills,
the day that the world sees. But the real day, the day that
deﬁnes who he is, started two hours earlier, in the darkness,
with animals who have no voice but whose gratitude is written
in every wagging tail, every nuzzling nose, every moment of
peace they ﬁnd because of him.
He does this every morning. And every evening, between 8:00
PM and 9:30 PM, he does it again. Rain or shine. Scorching
72

A LIFE BEYOND HIMSELF

heat or freezing cold. Healthy or sick. Festival or tragedy. For
thirty-two years, he has never missed a day. Not one. Because
to him, this isn’t a chore. It’s a calling. It’s who he is.
People ask him, often, why he does it.
“Why animals?” they say. “Why not focus on people? There are
so many poor children, so many homeless families. Why waste
food on dogs and cows?”
My father’s answer is always the same.
“Animals can’t ask for help,” he says quietly. “They can’t knock
on your door and say, ‘I’m hungry.’ They suffer in silence. And
if we don’t help them, no one will.”
He’s not dismissive of human suffering. He helps people
too—distributes blankets in winter, gives money to dailywage workers in need, supports children’s education through
donations. But animals hold a special place in his heart. Because
they are the most forgotten. The most invisible.
“If you feed someone who is hungry,” he once said, “you feed
your own soul.”
He didn’t make up that quote. It’s an old saying. But he lives
it like few others do. Feeding seventy animals twice a day for
thirty-two years is not cheap.
My father has spent lakhs—literally lakhs—of rupees on this.
Bread alone costs money. Biscuits cost money. And when bread
73

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

isn’t available, he buys grains, prepares food at home, carries it
in bags. People have offered to donate. To contribute. To help
lighten the ﬁnancial burden. My father always refuses.
“This is my seva,” he says. “My service. If I accept donations,
it becomes someone else’s. I want it to remain mine.” It’s not
pride. It’s purity. He wants his act of service to be completely
his own—uncompromised, unshared, untainted by obligation.
Even now, after retiring, with a modest pension, he continues.
And he has told me and my brother explicitly:
“When I’m gone, you continue this. Don’t let them go hungry.”
We’ve promised. And we will keep that promise.

The Love They Return
There’s a question people ask—usually with skepticism: “Do
the animals even care? Do they remember you?”
The answer is yes. Absolutely yes. My father has been bitten
by dogs—once, maybe twice—but never by the dogs he feeds.
They know him. They trust him. There are dogs that wait at the
same spot every morning, dogs that start wagging their tails
the moment they hear his footsteps, dogs that lick his hands
and feet—not begging, but thanking. There are cows that lower
their heads in a gesture of respect when he approaches, cows
that follow him for a few extra steps, as if reluctant to let him
go.
And there was one dog—an old, three-legged dog—that my
74

A LIFE BEYOND HIMSELF

father fed for years. It couldn’t walk well, couldn’t run, couldn’t
defend itself. But every morning and evening, it would drag
itself to the same corner, waiting.
One day, the dog wasn’t there. My father searched. Asked
around. Found out it had died—quietly, alone, in an alley. He
didn’t cry. But that evening, he sat in silence for a long time,
staring at the empty corner where the dog used to wait.
“That dog trusted me,” he said ﬁnally. “I’m glad I never let it
down.”
That, to me, is the essence of my father. Not grand philosophy.
Not abstract ideals.
Just: I’m glad I never let it down. There were times—many
times—when continuing this practice seemed impossible.
There was a year when my father fell ill. High fever, body aches,
weakness that made even standing difficult. My mother insisted
he rest.
“Just for today,” she said. “Someone else can feed them.”
My father shook his head. “They’re waiting.”
He went anyway. Slower. Weaker. But he went. There were
monsoon seasons when the rain was relentless, the roads
ﬂooded, the bags soaked.
He went anyway. There were days when ﬁnancial stress was
75

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

suffocating, when money was so tight that buying bread felt like
a luxury. He bought it anyway. Because he had made a promise.
Not to the animals—they don’t understand promises. But to
himself. To his father’s memory. To his belief that consistency
matters more than convenience.
“I don’t care if there’s a ﬂood, a storm, or a mountain in my
way,” he once said. “All I care about is feeding them.”
And he meant it.
I’ve accompanied my father on these walks a few times. Early
mornings when I was home visiting, when curiosity got the
better of me. And what struck me wasn’t the act itself—though
that was moving. What struck me was the peace on his face. He
wasn’t doing it grudgingly. He wasn’t doing it out of obligation.
He was doing it because it brought him joy.
I watched him kneel beside a mangy dog, scratching behind its
ears, speaking to it like a friend. I watched him smile when a
cow nuzzled his shoulder. I watched him count the pieces of
bread carefully, making sure every animal got a fair share. And
I realized: this is who he is. Not the government employee. Not
the father who sacriﬁced for our education. Not the man who
ran a tea stall in a canteen.
This.
This man, feeding voiceless creatures in the dark hours before
dawn, asking for nothing, expecting nothing—just giving
76

A LIFE BEYOND HIMSELF

because giving is its own reward. That is the truest version
of my father. And I am still learning how to be even a fraction
of that.

The Family He Built Around Him
But his generosity didn’t stop with animals. There is another
dimension to my father’s giving that most people never see—
the way he extended his sense of family beyond blood, beyond
obligation, to anyone who worked alongside him or came into
his orbit needing help.
In India, many families employ helping hands—domestic workers, cooks, part-time assistants—people who make our daily
lives possible but whose own lives are often marked by ﬁnancial
struggle. Most families pay them and consider the transaction
complete. My father never saw it as a transaction. He saw it as
a relationship. And in every relationship, he believed, you give
more than what’s expected.
For as long as I can remember, my father has quietly managed
the household expenses of the people who work in our home.
Not just their salary—everything. Their children’s school fees,
paid at the beginning of each term without being asked. Kitchen
gas cylinders, delivered before they ran out. TV cable bills,
paid monthly so their families could have the small comfort
of entertainment in the evenings after long days of labor. These
were not grand gestures announced with ceremony. They were
simply things he did, as naturally as breathing, because he
believed that if someone gives their time and effort to your
77

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

family, you owe them more than money—you owe them dignity,
security, and the peace of knowing their own family is taken
care of.
There is one person who embodies this bond more than anyone
else: Deepu Bhaiya. He has worked with our family for many
years, and over time, the relationship between him and my
father transcended the boundaries of employer and worker.
Deepu Bhaiya considers my father his own father, and my father
treats him exactly that way—with the same concern, the same
protectiveness, the same quiet investment in his future that he
gives to me and my brother. When Deepu Bhaiya needed help
with his family, my father was there. When he faced difficulties,
my father stepped in. Not because anyone asked. Not because
there was any obligation. But because that is who my father is:
a man who cannot see someone struggling without reaching
out.
And it wasn’t just Deepu Bhaiya. The workers at the Jain Mandir,
the laborers who helped build our home, the vendors who
supplied goods to the temple—anyone who came within the
circle of my father’s life found themselves cared for in ways they
didn’t expect. There are families across Lucknow—families
whose names I will never know—whose children went to school
because my father quietly paid their fees. Children who would
have dropped out, who would have been pulled into labor, who
would have lost their chance at a different life—and my father,
without fanfare, without even telling us, made sure that didn’t
happen. He paid for notebooks and uniforms and examination
fees, not because he was rich—he was never rich—but because
he believed that every child deserved the chance that he himself
78

A LIFE BEYOND HIMSELF

had fought so hard for.
Every father who reads this will recognize the impulse, even
if they’ve never acted on it at this scale. It’s the same impulse
that makes you tip generously when you see the waiter is young
and tired. The same impulse that makes you buy an extra meal
for the delivery driver. The same impulse that makes you stop
and help a stranger change a tire, even when you’re running
late. My father simply followed that impulse further than most
people dare, and he followed it every single day, for decades,
until it became not an impulse at all but a way of being.
In a world obsessed with taking, there is profound power in
giving. Not giving for recognition. Not giving for tax deductions.
Not giving because someone is watching. But giving because
you’ve seen suffering and you cannot walk past it.
My father feeds animals. He educates children who aren’t
his own. He supports families who work alongside him. He
gives to strangers who come to his door with stories he can’t
verify. The form doesn’t matter. The scale doesn’t matter.
What matters is the choice—the decision that says: I will not
be indifferent. I will not look away. I will not let suffering
exist in my presence without at least trying to ease it. That
choice, remade every single day, is what changes the world. Not
through grand revolutions or sweeping policies—but through
small, consistent acts of decency.
My father has fed over 600,000 animals in his lifetime. That’s
not an exaggeration. That’s math: 70 animals per day × 2 times
per day × 365 days × 32 years = 1,642,400 feedings. Over one and
79

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

a half million moments of compassion. And the world didn’t
change because of it. The news didn’t cover it. No award was
given. But 1.6 million times, a hungry creature was fed. 1.6
million times, suffering was eased. 1.6 million times, kindness
was chosen. And that, to me, is what heroism looks like.
“Thirty-two years. Not a single day missed. Not in rain, not in
fever, not in grief, not in celebration. Over 1.6 million feedings—
and not one of them was witnessed by anyone who could give
him an award or write him a headline. That is not discipline.
That is devotion. That is a man who found God not in a temple
but in the eyes of a hungry dog waiting at the corner of the street,
trusting that he would come.”
***

“The animals can’t ask for help. They can’t knock
on your door and say, ‘I’m hungry.’ They suffer in
silence. And if we don’t help them, no one will. My
father understood this—not as philosophy, but as fact.
And so he became their voice, their provider, their only
certainty in a world that had forgotten them.”
“Some souls ﬁnd peace only in giving.
are not built for accumulation.

They

They are built

for distribution—of love, of food, of kindness, of
themselves. My father is one of those souls. He gives
until there is nothing left, and then he gives his time,
his presence, his faith. And somehow, there is always

80

A LIFE BEYOND HIMSELF

more.”
“This is my seva, he told me once. My service. If I
accept donations, it becomes someone else’s. I want
it to remain mine. That single sentence contains
everything you need to know about the man.”

81

Stone and Spirit

W

hen faith meets labor, even stone can breathe.
There are two kinds of devotion in this world.
The ﬁrst is loud. It announces itself through rituals

performed in public, through grand displays of piety, through
words spoken with certainty and volume. It wants to be seen,
acknowledged, praised.

82

STONE AND SPIRIT

The second is quiet. It shows up early, stays late, does the
work no one notices. It doesn’t speak about faith—it lives it.
It doesn’t demand recognition—it ﬁnds fulﬁllment in the act
itself.
My father has always practiced the second kind. He is deeply
religious. A Jain by birth and conviction. But his faith has never
been about rules for the sake of rules, or rituals for the sake
of appearance. His faith is simple: Serve. Give. Build. Do
good. And for decades, that faith found expression not just in
feeding animals, but in building and maintaining the temple—
the mandir—that became his second home.
This is the story of his spiritual service. The hours spent
in silence, the labor offered freely, the leadership accepted
reluctantly, and the community transformed quietly.

The Temple That Needed Him
The Jain Mandir in our neighborhood was not grand. No marble
ﬂoors, no ornate carvings, no towering spires. Just a modest
building where the local Jain community gathered for prayers,
festivals, and rituals. But modest doesn’t mean unimportant.
For the families who came there, it was a sanctuary. A place to
reconnect with faith, with community, with something larger
than themselves.
The temple needed volunteers. People willing to clean, organize, prepare for festivals, handle logistics. Most community
members attended prayers and then left. Few stayed to serve.
83

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

My father stayed.
It started small. Helping with setup before festivals. Arranging
chairs. Cleaning ﬂoors. Tasks that required no skill, just
willingness. But over time, people noticed. Not because he
sought attention, but because he was always there. Reliable.
Steady. Quiet. When the temple needed someone to manage
inventory—keeping track of religious items, oil for lamps,
incense—they asked my father.
He said yes.
When they needed someone to coordinate volunteers, to organize events, to handle ﬁnances transparently—they asked my
father.
He said yes. And eventually, when the community needed a
president—someone to lead the temple committee, to represent
them, to guide decisions—they asked my father.
He hesitated.
“I’m not a leader,” he said. “I’m just a volunteer.”
“That’s exactly why we’re asking you,” they replied.
And so he became president of the Jain Mandir—not because
he wanted the title, but because the community trusted him.
Being president of a temple is not ceremonial.

It’s work.

Endless, unglamorous work. Every festival required planning,
sometimes weeks in advance. Every ritual required preparation.
84

STONE AND SPIRIT

Every dispute within the community required mediation. And
my father did it all—not with authority that demanded obedience, but with humility that invited cooperation. He would
arrive at the temple hours before events started, make sure
everything was in place, make sure nothing was forgotten. He
would stay hours after everyone left—lock the doors, clean up,
make sure the space was ready for the next gathering.
People saw him during prayers. They didn’t see him at 6 AM,
sweeping the temple ﬂoors. They didn’t see him late at night,
reviewing accounts to ensure every rupee was accounted for.
They didn’t see the phone calls—members asking for help,
requesting exceptions, voicing complaints—or the patience
it required to listen, to mediate, to ﬁnd solutions that honored
everyone. They just saw a man who led with grace, who never
raised his voice, who never made decisions unilaterally, who
always asked, “What does the community need?”

The Blanket Distribution
One winter, my father had an idea. Lucknow winters can be
brutal, especially for the homeless—people sleeping on pavements, under bridges, covered only by thin shawls or nothing
at all. Every year, people died from the cold. My father thought:
We should do something. He proposed to the temple committee
a blanket distribution drive—use temple funds, donated by the
community, to buy blankets and distribute them to the poor.
Some committee members hesitated. “Shouldn’t temple funds
stay within the community? For religious purposes?” My father
smiled gently. “What’s more religious than helping those who
are suffering?” The committee agreed.
85

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

That December, my father organized the ﬁrst blanket distribution. He used temple funds to purchase 50 blankets. Then he,
along with a few volunteers, went into the streets—areas where
the homeless gathered—and distributed them personally.
No media coverage. No photo ops. No announcements.
Just my father and a few others, handing warm blankets to
people who had nothing.
One man—an elderly homeless man—took the blanket,
wrapped it around his shoulders, and wept.
“Thank you,” he whispered. “Thank you.”
My father nodded. “Stay warm, uncle.”
The next year, they distributed 100 blankets. The year after, 150.
Word spread. Other community members wanted to participate.
Some donated money speciﬁcally for the blanket drive. Some
joined the distribution walks. And it all started because my
father believed that faith without action is hollow.
My father’s work at the temple did more than organize events
or distribute blankets. It inspired others. One of his closest
friends, Ajay Jain, saw what my father was doing and decided to
join him. Not just occasionally—fully. Together, they expanded
the temple’s social service work. Together, they brought more
people into the fold.
Another elder in the community, Vipin Jain, whom my father
86

STONE AND SPIRIT

deeply respected, became a mentor and supporter. He encouraged my father to think bigger, to not limit his service to the
temple walls but to extend it to the broader community.
And slowly, the culture of the temple changed. It wasn’t just
a place for rituals. It became a place for service. People who
had never volunteered before started showing up. Families who
had been passive members became active participants. Young
people, inspired by my father’s example, began organizing their
own initiatives. And through it all, my father remained in the
background. Never taking credit. Never seeking praise.
When people thanked him, he would deﬂect. “It’s not me. It’s
all of us. We’re doing this together.”
But everyone knew. Everyone understood. He was the catalyst.

The Balance Between Faith and Life
One thing that always impressed me about my father’s spirituality: it never made him rigid. He was deeply religious, yes. He
followed Jain principles—vegetarianism, non-violence, regular
prayers. But he never imposed those principles on others.
When me and my brother made choices he didn’t fully agree
with, he accepted them. When we questioned rituals, he listened.
When we expressed doubts, he didn’t lecture—he shared his
perspective, and left the rest to us.
“Faith is personal,” he once said. “I can show you what works
for me. But you have to ﬁnd what works for you.”
87

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

That openness, that refusal to be dogmatic, made his faith more
powerful. Because it was genuine. Not performed. Not forced.
Just lived. And it taught me something crucial: true spirituality
is not about rules. It’s about values.
My father’s values—kindness, service, humility, compassion—
are the essence of every major religion. And he embodies them
not because he’s trying to be holy, but because he genuinely
believes that’s how life should be lived. I was never as religious
as my father. I attended temple with him when I was young, but
as I grew older, I drifted away. Not out of rebellion—just out of
indifference.
I didn’t see the point. The rituals felt repetitive. The prayers
felt abstract.
But then I watched my father. I watched him volunteer for hours,
lead with humility, serve without expectation. I watched the
way the community respected him—not because of his title, but
because of his character. And I realized: religion, for him, was
never about the rituals. It was about the service.
The temple was just the place where that service happened. But
the spirit of it—the actual devotion—was in the blankets he
distributed, the animals he fed, the people he helped. Faith, for
my father, was not theoretical. It was practical.
And that’s a faith I can respect. Even if I don’t practice it the
same way, I understand it. I honor it. Because I see what it
produces: a life of meaning, purpose, and peace.

88

STONE AND SPIRIT

Every community needs people like my father. People who show
up. Who do the work no one wants to do. Who lead without
demanding power. These are the people who hold communities
together. Not through grand speeches or bold declarations, but
through quiet, consistent presence.
They are the ones who arrive early and leave late. Who volunteer
for thankless tasks. Who mediate disputes without taking sides.
Who give generously and expect nothing in return. And slowly,
without anyone quite noticing, they transform the culture
around them.
Because service is contagious. When people see someone giving
selﬂessly, they start to think: Maybe I can do that too. That’s
what my father did. He didn’t preach. He didn’t demand. He
just lived a certain way. And others followed.
That’s the power of example. It doesn’t argue. It doesn’t
persuade. It just is.
And over time, it changes everything.
***

“My father never preached. He never quoted scripture to
prove a point or invoked God’s name to win an argument.
He just lived.

And in that living—in the blankets

distributed, the floors swept, the festivals organized, the
disputes quietly resolved—he taught me more about

89

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

faith than a thousand sermons ever could.

Because

true devotion is not measured by prayers spoken. It is
measured by burdens lifted.”
“When people saw him giving selflessly, something shifted
in them. They began to think: maybe I can do that too.
And slowly, without anyone quite noticing, the culture
changed. That is the power of example. It doesn’t argue.
It doesn’t persuade. It just is. And over time, it changes
everything.”
“A temple without service is just a building with beautiful
walls. Service without a temple is still sacred. My father
understood this distinction instinctively, and he built his
faith not in stone but in action—one blanket at a time,
one meal at a time, one act of kindness at a time.”
“What’s more religious than helping those who are
suffering? That question, asked gently in a committee
meeting, silenced every objection. Because there was no
answer. There is no answer. And my father knew it.”

90

A House Made of Love

A

home is not built of bricks, but of laughter, prayer, and
the scent of food shared.
There is a difference between a house and a home. A

house is walls and roof and rooms. It’s property. It’s investment.
It’s square footage and market value.
A home is something else entirely. It’s where you feel safe.

91

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Where you can be yourself. Where love doesn’t need to announce itself because it’s woven into everything—the worn
cushions on the couch, the scuff marks on the ﬂoor, the kitchen
that smells like your mother’s cooking.
Some people spend their whole lives building houses—bigger,
grander, more impressive. But they never quite manage to build
a home. My father built both. But he built the home ﬁrst—
long before the house existed. And the foundation of that home
wasn’t concrete or steel. It was his belief that his children’s
future mattered more than his own comfort.
This is the story of the biggest ﬁnancial risk he ever took. The
decision that could have bankrupted him. The sacriﬁce that
changed our lives.

The Letter That Changed Everything
The year was 2011. Me and my twin brother were eighteen,
about to graduate from high school. We had worked hard. We
had studied relentlessly. We had taken the AIEEE exam—the
national engineering entrance test—and waited anxiously for
results. When the results came, we had options. Government
colleges in Uttar Pradesh. Private colleges with decent rankings.
State universities with reasonable fees.
And then, one letter arrived that wasn’t like the others.
Thapar University, Punjab
Admission Offer Based on AIEEE Rank

92

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

Thapar was—and still is—one of India’s top private engineering
universities. Known for its faculty, infrastructure, placements.
Students who graduated from Thapar went to top companies,
top graduate schools. It was the kind of institution that opened
doors.
But there was one problem. The fees. Annual tuition: Rs. 2.5
lakhs. Four years: Rs. 10 lakhs. Plus hostel, plus books, plus
living expenses. Total cost, conservatively: Rs. 12 lakhs per
son. For both of us: Rs. 24 lakhs. My father’s annual salary at
the time: Rs. 4.5 lakhs. The math was impossible. Absolutely
impossible.
Most parents would have said, “This is unrealistic. Choose a
government college. It’s good enough.” Most parents would
have been right. But my father didn’t say that. He said, “Let
me think about it.” My father is methodical. He doesn’t make
emotional decisions. He gathers data, analyzes options, weighs
outcomes. So he researched.
He went online—spending hours on slow internet connections—
reading about Thapar’s placement records. He called alumni.
He spoke to parents whose children had graduated from there.
He compared it with the government colleges we had been
accepted to. And he came to a conclusion.
“Thapar is better,” he said quietly one evening. “Much better.
The placements alone make it worth it.” My mother looked at
him. “But how will we pay?”
“We’ll ﬁgure it out.”
93

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“LP Ji,” she said, her voice careful. “This isn’t a small amount.
This is our entire savings. This is—”
“I know,” my father interrupted gently. “But if we don’t invest
in their education now, what are we saving for?” She had no
answer to that. Neither did I.
My father sat me and my brother down.
“I’m putting you both in Thapar,” he said.
We stared at him. “Both?”
“Both.”
“But Papa,” my brother said, “that’s—”
“I know how much it costs,” my father said. “And I’ve thought
about it carefully. I’ve checked the placements. I’ve looked at
the opportunities. This is the best choice.”
“But how will you—”
“Don’t worry about that,” he said ﬁrmly. “That’s my responsibility. Your responsibility is to study. To work hard. To make
the most of this opportunity.”
He looked at us—really looked at us—and his voice softened.
“I didn’t have these chances. I worked from the time I was ten
years old. I never had the luxury of focusing only on studies.
94

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

But you do. And I’m not going to waste that.”
We nodded, too overwhelmed to speak. What we didn’t know—
what he didn’t tell us until years later—was what he gave up
to make this happen. He broke his ﬁxed deposits. Money he
had saved for decades, earning modest interest, meant for
emergencies—gone.
He sold the land he had purchased ten years earlier. A plot on
the outskirts of Lucknow that, if held for another decade, would
have been worth crores. But he sold it immediately, at a fraction
of its potential value, to pay our fees. He took an education loan.
A large one. And he repaid it quietly, over years, without ever
mentioning the burden.
He didn’t buy a new car. He didn’t renovate the house. He
didn’t take vacations. For four years, every rupee went toward
our education. And he did it with a smile. With pride. With the
absolute conviction that this was the right choice.

The House and The Hope
In 2008, when me and my brother were ﬁfteen years old, my
father decided to build a proper home for us. Not just a room—a
house. A place where we could grow up with space, with dignity,
with the stability he had never had.
He had saved money over years. Small amounts, carefully
set aside.

Combined with a loan, it was enough to begin

construction on a plot of land he had purchased years earlier.

95

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

The construction started with hope. Workers arrived. Foundations were laid. Walls began to rise. My father would visit
the site every evening after work, watching the structure take
shape, imagining our future within those walls.
When the ﬂoor and ceiling were ﬁrst laid, they seemed steady
enough. The brickwork looked solid. The wooden logs that
supported the structure appeared strong. My father stood inside
the incomplete house, looking up at the ceiling, and allowed
himself to dream.
This will be our home. This will be where my sons grow up.
This will be where memories are made. But then the rains came.
The monsoon that year was relentless. Day after day, water
poured from the sky, ﬂooding streets, soaking everything. And
the house—the house my father had poured his savings into—
began to show its weakness.
The simple brickwork couldn’t withstand the weight of the
water. The wooden logs, soaked through, began to sag. And one
morning, when my father arrived at the site, he found it: the
structure had sunk. The ﬂoor had collapsed inward. The ceiling
had bowed dangerously low. The walls, though still standing,
were cracked and unstable.
One of the workers approached him, his face grim.
“Sir,” he said quietly, “the damage is extensive. The foundation
wasn’t strong enough for this much water. To rebuild properly,
to make it strong enough to withstand the rains, will cost much
more. Almost double what you’ve already spent.”
96

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

My father didn’t respond immediately. He walked into what
remained of the house, his shoes sinking into mud, and knelt
down. He placed his hands on the damaged ﬂoor, feeling the
cracks beneath his palms. And then he looked up at the sagging
ceiling, at the water still dripping through gaps in the roof.
And in that moment, I saw something in my father’s eyes that I
had never seen before.
Not anger. Not frustration. Not even despair.
Just a profound, overwhelming sadness. The kind that comes
when you realize that everything you’ve worked for, everything
you’ve sacriﬁced for, has collapsed in front of you.
His eyes went numb. Empty. As if something inside him had
broken.
He stayed there, kneeling in the mud, for what felt like an
eternity. The workers stood outside, waiting, unsure what to
do. The rain continued to fall.
And then, slowly, my father stood. He wiped his hands on his
pants. He looked at the worker who had delivered the news.
“Start again,” he said quietly. “Tomorrow. We’ll rebuild it
properly this time.”
The worker hesitated. “But sir, the cost—”
“I’ll ﬁnd a way,” my father said. “This is my sons’ home. It has
97

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

to be strong.”
And so they began again. The next day, my father was there
at dawn, working alongside the laborers. He lifted bricks. He
mixed cement. He carried heavy loads. He did everything the
workers did, because every rupee saved was a rupee that could
go toward making the structure stronger.
Many times, he got injured. His knees bled from kneeling on
rough surfaces. His hands developed blisters that broke and
bled. His back ached from lifting. But he never stopped. He
never complained.
And when the structure was ﬁnally up again—when the walls
were rebuilt, when the foundation was reinforced, when the
ceiling was properly supported—my father did something that
the workers had never seen before.
Every evening, after the day’s work was done, he would climb
onto the roof with buckets of water. And he would pour water
over the newly laid concrete, slowly, methodically, ensuring it
cured properly. He would do this for hours, walking back and
forth, carrying water up and down ladders, until the roof was
completely soaked.
“Why are you doing this?” one worker asked him. “The concrete
will cure on its own.”
My father looked at him, his face serious. “I need to be sure,” he
said. “I need to know it’s strong. I can’t let this happen again.”

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

He did this for weeks. Every single evening. Pouring water,
checking for cracks, ensuring the structure was solid. And when
the house was ﬁnally complete—when we moved in, when we
slept under that roof for the ﬁrst time—my father stood outside,
looking up at it, and I saw him smile. Not a triumphant smile.
Not a proud smile.
Just relief. The relief of knowing that this time, it would hold.
Years later, when I asked him about that day—the day the house
sank, the day his eyes went numb—he was quiet for a long time.
“That was the hardest day,” he ﬁnally said. “Not because of the
money. Money can be earned again. But because I had failed. I
had failed to give you a home that was strong enough. And that
hurt more than anything.”
“But you rebuilt it,” I said. “You made it stronger.”
He nodded. “I had to. Because a home isn’t just walls and a
roof. It’s a promise. A promise that you’ll be safe. That you’ll
be protected. And I couldn’t break that promise.”
That house still stands today. It has weathered many monsoons
since then. It has sheltered us through storms, through celebrations, through everything life has brought.
And every time I walk through its doors, I remember: this house
was built twice. Once with hope. Once with determination. And
the second time, it was built to last.

The Train
Every semester, when it was time to return to college after
holidays, my father would book our train tickets. Always AC
coach. Always comfortable seats. We didn’t think much of it.
We assumed that’s just how it was done.
But years later, I learned: my father never traveled AC. Not once.
He always took sleeper class—or sometimes general class—
because it was cheaper.
But for us? Always AC.
“Why didn’t you tell us?” I asked him, frustrated. “We would
have been ﬁne in sleeper.”
He smiled. “You were students. You needed to be comfortable.
To arrive rested. I’m used to hard seats.”
That was his philosophy—always, without exception, for as
long as I can remember. His comfort didn’t matter. Ours
did. And I realize now, looking back, that this is the unspoken
contract of fatherhood—a contract signed not on paper but in
the quiet decisions made when no one is watching: the cheaper
seat chosen, the older clothes worn, the meal skipped, the
dream deferred. Every father knows this contract. Every father
has signed it. And most of them, like mine, never mention it.

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

The Marriage
When I got married in 2020, my wife Naincy came into our
family. She was nervous, as any new bride would be—entering
a new home, meeting new people, learning new routines. But
my father, from the very ﬁrst day, made her feel seen. Not just
welcomed—truly seen.
Every morning, he would ask her, “Are you okay? Do you need
anything? Is everything ﬁne?” Not perfunctory questions.
Real ones. He would look at her face, read her expression, and
know—without her saying a word—if something was wrong.
My wife tells me that in those early days, she was struck by
how much he reminded her of her own father. The same gentle
concern. The same quiet attention. The same way of noticing
things others missed. “He doesn’t just ask if I’m okay,” she
told me once. “He actually wants to know. And he remembers.
If I mention liking something once, he remembers it forever.”
She remembers, in particular, the snacks.

My wife loves

dhokla—those soft, spongy Gujarati snacks. And she loves
blueberries. But these aren’t things you ﬁnd easily in Lucknow.
You have to go to speciﬁc markets, sometimes far from our
home.
But whenever the season for blueberries arrived, my father
would appear with a box of them. Without being asked. Without
anyone mentioning it. He would just show up, hand her the box,
and say, “I thought you might like these.”

101

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

And dhokla? He would travel across the city to ﬁnd the best
ones, bringing them home in the evening, placing them on the
table with a simple, “I got these for you.” My wife was always
touched, but also confused. “How does he know?” she would
ask me. “I never told him I liked these things.”
“He just watches,” I would tell her. “He pays attention. That’s
who he is.” But the moment that truly showed her who my
father was came one day when she was unwell.
I was heavy with office work, buried in deadlines, unable to be
home. My wife was feeling sick—nothing serious, just a bad
cold, but enough to make her miserable. She didn’t complain.
She didn’t ask for help. She just tried to push through.
But my father noticed.
He saw her moving slowly. He saw her wincing when she
thought no one was looking. He saw the exhaustion in her eyes.
And without saying a word, without asking permission, he went
into the kitchen and cooked. Not just for her—for the whole
family. He prepared a full meal, making sure everything was
ready, that everyone would be fed, that my wife wouldn’t have
to worry about anything.
When my wife came out of the room, expecting to have to cook
despite feeling terrible, she found the table set, food ready, and
my father quietly cleaning up.
“You didn’t have to do this,” she said, her voice thick with
102

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

emotion.
My father just smiled. “You’re not feeling well. Rest. Everything
is taken care of.”
She never forgot that. The way he saw her need without her
having to voice it. The way he stepped in without being asked.
The way he made her feel like family, not like an outsider who
had to earn her place.
But there’s another story she tells—one that happened months
later, one that showed her the depth of his care. We were all
going to the Jain Mandir for night prayers. The entire family—
me, my brother Avinash, our wives, my mother, and my father.
It was a special occasion, and we stayed late, participating in
the rituals, listening to the prayers.
By the time everything ended, it was around 9 PM. We were all
tired, ready to go home, ready to rest.
We gathered outside the temple, preparing to leave. But when
we looked around, we couldn’t ﬁnd my father.
“Where is Papa?” my mother asked. We searched. We called.
But he wasn’t there. Assuming he had gone ahead, we returned
home. And when we walked through the door, we found him in
the kitchen.
He had made chapatis. Fresh, warm chapatis. Enough for
everyone. He was standing at the stove, rolling out the last
one, his hands covered in ﬂour, a gentle smile on his face.
103

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“You’re all tired,” he said. “I thought you might be hungry when
you got home.”
We stood there, all of us, struck silent by the thoughtfulness.
By the care. By the way he had anticipated our needs before we
even knew we had them. My wife looked at me, tears in her eyes,
and whispered, “This is what love looks like, isn’t it?”
Yes. This is what love looks like. Not grand gestures. Not
expensive gifts. Not words spoken loudly. Just chapatis made at
9 PM because he thought we might be hungry. Just blueberries
brought from across the city because he remembered she liked
them. Just stepping in to cook when someone is unwell, without
being asked, without expecting thanks.
This is the silent strength. This is my father.
And my wife, who came into our family as a stranger, learned
quickly: in this house, you are never alone. You are always
seen. You are always cared for. Because that’s who he is. That’s
what he does. And this is what fathers do everywhere—in every
culture, in every country, in every home. They see burden, and
they lift it. They see struggle, and they ease it. They see their
children drowning in responsibility, and they step in without
being asked, without expecting thanks, without making anyone
feel like they’re a burden.
They handle every household chore without hesitation—
cooking, cleaning, managing, organizing—whatever needs
to be done, they do it. They step in when someone needs
help. They do the work that no one wants to do, the work that
104

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

goes unnoticed and unappreciated. And they do it silently,
consistently, without complaint.
Because that’s what love looks like. Not grand gestures. Not
expensive gifts. Not words spoken loudly. Just chores handled.
Work done. Burdens lifted. Help given. Silently. Consistently.
Without asking for anything in return.
This is the silent strength. This is what fathers do. And we, their
children, often don’t recognize it until it’s too late. Until we
become fathers ourselves. Until we understand the weight they
carried, the sacriﬁces they made, the love they gave without
ever asking for acknowledgment. Only then do we see: they
were heroes all along. We just didn’t know it.

The Goodness Comes Back to You
When my brother’s admission to Thapar was being processed,
my father made a mistake.
He had initially conﬁrmed the seat. But then, when Jaypee
Institute Noida—a college closer to home and cheaper—also
offered admission, my father second-guessed himself. Maybe
Jaypee is better. Maybe I’m making the wrong choice. Maybe I
should save money.
He sent a cancellation request to Thapar. But then, after
researching further, he realized: Thapar was unquestionably
better. The placements, the faculty, the opportunities—there
was no comparison.
105

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

He panicked. He called Thapar. “I need to reverse the cancellation. Please. My son’s future depends on this.” The admissions
office was ﬁrm. “We can’t do that. The cancellation is processed.
The seat is gone.”
My father didn’t know what to do. If my brother lost his seat,
I would lose mine too—they had given us admission together.
Then he remembered: he had a friend. A colleague whose friend
lived in Patiala, near Thapar.
He called. Explained the situation. Asked if there was any way
to help. The friend—Lalit Kumar—was surprised to hear my
father’s name.
“Chandra Prakash Jain?” he said. “Is that you?”
“Yes,” my father said. “Do I know you?”
“You don’t remember,” Lalit said quietly. “But I remember
you.”
Years earlier, my father had been handling union duties at his
office. A transfer request had come to his desk—a request
to stop someone’s transfer due to family circumstances. The
request had no name my father recognized. Just a situation: a
man whose family would be devastated by relocation.
My father approved the stop. No questions asked. Just: If his
family needs him, let him stay.
That man was Lalit Kumar. And now, years later, Lalit had the
106

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

chance to return the favor.
He went directly to Thapar University. Spoke to a professor
friend in the admissions department. Explained the situation.
Vouched for my father’s character. And the professor, moved
by the story, reversed the cancellation.
My brother’s seat was restored. And with it, mine. When my
father learned what had happened, he sat in silence for a long
time.
“I didn’t even know his name,” he ﬁnally said. “I just did what
felt right.” That’s the universe, I suppose. Goodness doesn’t
always return immediately. But it returns.
Not everyone supported my father’s decision. Friends told him,
“You’re being reckless. You’ll lose everything. What if they
don’t get jobs? What if the investment doesn’t pay off?”
Family members warned, “You should have kept that land. In
ten years, it’ll be worth ten times what you sold it for. You’re
sacriﬁcing your future for theirs.” One friend said bluntly,
“You’re a fool, Jain. You’ll regret this.”
My father listened. Smiled. And said:
“My backup plan is God and good intentions. What else do I
need?”
He wasn’t being ﬂippant. He genuinely believed it. He had spent
his entire life giving—to animals, to the poor, to anyone in need.
107

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

He trusted that if he acted with a pure heart, things would work
out.
And they did. We graduated. Both of us. With engineering
degrees. From Thapar University.
We got jobs. Good jobs. At reputable companies. With salaries
that, in our ﬁrst year, exceeded what my father earned after
thirty years of service. We repaid him. Not ﬁnancially—he
refused to take money from us. But in other ways. In the pride
he felt. In the peace of knowing we were stable, secure, set up
for futures he could only have dreamed of. And the land he sold?
Yes, it would have been worth crores today.
But he doesn’t regret it. Not for a second. “I can’t take land with
me when I die,” he once said. “But I can take the knowledge
that I gave my sons the best chance I could.”
That’s the kind of man he is. Not calculating. Not strategic. Just
guided by love.

***
I think about that decision often. The sheer audacity of it. The
risk. Twenty-four lakhs. For two sons. On a salary of 4.5 lakhs.
Any ﬁnancial advisor would have called it insane. But my father
didn’t consult ﬁnancial advisors. He consulted his heart. And
his heart said: Your children’s future is worth any risk.

108

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

I’m thirty-three now. I have a career. Stability. Options. And
none of it would exist without that decision. I didn’t earn this
life. My father built it for me. Brick by brick. Sacriﬁce by
sacriﬁce. And I can never fully repay that. I can only honor
it. By living well. By working hard. By, one day, doing for my
own children what he did for me.
Every parent faces this choice, in one form or another.
Do I prioritize my comfort or my children’s future?
Do I save for myself or invest in them?
Do I play it safe or take the risk?
Some parents choose safety. They protect their assets, their
security, their retirement plans. And that’s understandable.
Rational, even. But others—like my father—choose differently.
They bet everything on their children. They sacriﬁce their
present for their children’s future. And those children grow
up with a debt they can never repay. Not because their parents
demand repayment, but because the gift is too large. Too
profound.
All we can do is try to live lives worthy of that sacriﬁce.
And hope that, when our time comes, we’ll have the courage to
give as freely as they did.

***

109

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“He sold land that would have been worth crores. He
broke fixed deposits. He took loans he never mentioned.
He gave us AC train tickets while he sat in general class.
And when a friend called him a fool for risking everything,
he smiled and said: my backup plan is God and good
intentions. What else do I need? That answer is the
difference between a man who calculates and a man who
loves. My father never calculated. He just loved.”
“A home isn’t just walls and a roof. It’s a promise—
a promise that you’ll be safe, that you’ll be protected,
that the people inside those walls will always choose you
over comfort, over security, over themselves. My father
built that promise twice. Once with hope. Once with
determination. And the second time, he built it to last.”
“This is what love looks like in the real world—not flowers
and poetry and grand declarations, but chapatis made at
9 PM because he thought we might be hungry. Blueberries
brought from across the city because he remembered she
liked them. Dishes washed silently because he saw the
burden and chose to lift it. Love, in its truest form, is not a
feeling. It is a verb. It is something you do, over and over,
until it becomes who you are.”
“Good deeds don’t disappear. They travel through time
and space, waiting for the moment they are needed most.
A transfer stopped years ago for a man whose name you
never knew becomes the phone call that saves your son’s

110

A HOUSE MADE OF LOVE

future. That is the mathematics of grace.”

111

The Mirror of Time

I

n the end, what we remember are not the years, but the
moments that changed us. Time has a strange quality. It
moves slowly when we’re young—summers felt endless,

school years stretched forever. But as we age, it accelerates.
Days blur into weeks. Weeks into years. And suddenly, we look
back and wonder: Where did it all go?
But within that rush, certain moments remain crystallized.
Perfectly preserved. Not because they were grand or dramatic,

112

THE MIRROR OF TIME

but because they revealed something essential about the people
we love. A friend showing up at midnight when you needed
help. A stranger giving blood when you were dying. A colleague
helping your son get into college because you once stopped his
transfer without knowing his name.
These moments don’t fade. They become the stories we tell.
The memories we return to. The evidence that life, despite its
hardships, is ultimately good. My father’s life is full of such
moments. Not because he sought them, but because he lived in
a way that invited them.
This is the story of those friendships. Those acts of service.
Those moments when goodness was repaid with goodness.

The Friends Who Became Family
My father doesn’t have many friends. He’s not the type to collect
acquaintances or build vast networks. But the friends he has?
They are not just friends. They are brothers.
There is Sudhir Mishra—Mishra ji, as we call him. A man my
father has known for decades. Through job changes, family
crises, health scares—Mishra ji has been constant.
There is Kamal Uncle. Another colleague from the Indian
Meteorological Department. A man who trusted my father
enough to call him at 1 AM when his brother-in-law needed
blood. And my father went. No questions. No hesitation.
There is Bacha Singh. A man who suffered four heart attacks in
113

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

sixteen years. And every time—every single time—my father
was there. At the hospital. Offering money. Offering presence.
Offering the kind of support that says, You’re not alone.
These men saw my father not as a colleague, but as family. And
he saw them the same way. One night, years ago, my father’s
phone rang. It was 1:00 AM. The house was silent. My mother,
me, my brother—all asleep. My father answered, his voice
groggy. “Hello?”
“Jain,” came the voice on the other end. Kamal Uncle. Panicked.
“I need your help.”
“What happened?”
“My brother-in-law. Accident. He’s bleeding badly. Hospital
needs blood. O-positive. Can you—” “I’m coming,” my father
said. He was already getting out of bed, pulling on his shirt.
“Are you sure? It’s late, and—”
“I’m coming,” my father repeated. “Which hospital?” Fifteen
minutes later, he was there. Rolling up his sleeve. Sitting in
the donation chair. The doctors took his blood. It was given to
Kamal Uncle’s brother-in-law. And for a few hours, that blood
kept the man alive.
He died later that night anyway. The injuries were too severe.
But my father’s blood gave the family time. Time to say goodbye.
Time to gather. Time to process. Kamal Uncle never forgot.
“You came at 1 AM,” he said months later, his voice thick with
114

THE MIRROR OF TIME

emotion. “No questions. No hesitation. Just: ‘I’m coming.’”
My father shrugged. “What else would I do?” To him, it wasn’t
heroic. It was obvious. A friend needed help. He helped. That’s
all.
Bacha Singh was one of my father’s closest friends. A jovial
man, full of laughter, always ready with a joke. And then, one
day, he wasn’t. He suffered a stroke. Paralysis on one side
of his body. Doctors said he might never walk again. Bacha
Singh was devastated. He lay in the hospital bed, staring at the
ceiling, refusing visitors. He didn’t want anyone to see him like
this—weak, helpless, broken. But my father and Mishra ji went
anyway.
They walked into his hospital room unannounced. Bacha Singh
looked at them, and for a moment, he wanted to cry.
“I can’t walk,” he said quietly.
“Not yet,” my father said. “But you will.”
“You don’t understand. The doctors said—”
“Forget the doctors,” Mishra ji interrupted. “You’re going to
walk. Right now.”
Bacha Singh stared at them. “What?”
“Get up,” my father said gently. “Try.”

115

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“I can’t—”
“Try.”
Slowly, painfully, Bacha Singh swung his legs over the side of
the bed. My father and Mishra ji moved to help him, but he held
up his hand.
“No,” he said. “If I’m going to do this, I have to do it myself.”
He stood. His legs trembled. His body swayed. And then, step by
agonizing step, he walked. Three feet. Five feet. Ten feet. And
then he collapsed back onto the bed, gasping, tears streaming
down his face.
“I walked,” he whispered. “I walked.” My father and Mishra ji
were crying too. Bacha Singh recovered—not fully, he still has
limitations—but he walks. He lives independently. He laughs
again. And he credits my father. “You made me believe I could,”
he said. “That’s what gave me strength.”
There was a colleague at my father’s office named Sanjay Singh
whose father died suddenly, leaving the family in ﬁnancial
ruin—debts, funeral costs, no savings. Sanjay was desperate.
He approached several colleagues, asking for loans. Most
refused. Times were hard. Money was tight. He came to my
father last, almost apologetically.
“I know you have your own family,” Sanjay said. “But I don’t
know where else to turn.”

116

THE MIRROR OF TIME

My father didn’t hesitate. “How much do you need?”
Sanjay named a ﬁgure.

My father nodded.

“I’ll bring it

tomorrow.”
The next day, my father gave him the money. No formal
contract. No interest. Just: “Pay me back when you can.” It
took Sanjay two years to repay it. And when he ﬁnally did, he
tried to give my father extra—interest, as thanks. My father
refused. “I didn’t lend it to make money. I lent it because you
needed it.” Sanjay still talks about that moment. “He trusted
me,” he said. “When no one else did.”
Not every act of kindness is repaid. There was a man—a
stranger—who approached my father outside his office one
day.
“Sir,” the man said, “I need help. I was robbed. Lost all my
money. I need to get to Ambedkar Nagar. My family is there.
Can you help me?”
He looked desperate. His clothes were torn. His face was gaunt.
My father gave him money. Enough for travel and food. The
man thanked him profusely and left.
The next day, my father saw the same man approaching another
person in the same area, telling the same story. He had been
scammed. When Mishra ji found out, he was furious. “You
should report him! Get your money back!”
My father shook his head. “It’s ﬁne.”
117

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

“It’s not ﬁne! He lied to you!”
“Maybe he did,” my father said. “Or maybe he was desperate.
Either way, I gave the money freely. What he does with it is his
responsibility. What I do with mine is mine.”
That’s my father’s philosophy. He doesn’t give with conditions.
He gives because giving is right. And if someone takes advantage? That’s on them. Not him.

The COVID Service
When COVID-19 hit India in 2020, our neighborhood—an
industrial area ﬁlled with daily-wage laborers—was devastated.
Lockdowns meant no work. No work meant no income. No income meant no food. Families were starving, literally starving—
they couldn’t leave their homes, couldn’t earn, and many had no
savings to fall back on. My father saw this and acted. He started
preparing ration kits—rice, lentils, ﬂour, oil, basic necessities—
and every day he would pack these kits himself, load them into
bags, and go door to door, distributing them. He didn’t ask if
people were deserving. He didn’t check if they really needed it.
If someone came to the door, he gave. Some people abused it—
took more than they needed, lied about their circumstances.
But most were genuinely desperate, and for those families,
my father’s ration kits were the difference between eating and
going hungry.
He did this for months, until the worst of the pandemic passed,
until people could work again. No one asked him to. No
government program funded it. No NGO supported it. Just my
118

THE MIRROR OF TIME

father, using his own income, feeding the hungry. Because
that’s what he does.
I’ve been writing this chapter for hours. It’s 4:27 AM now. My
tea has gone cold. My eyes ache. But I can’t stop, because every
time I think I’ve captured the essence of my father, another
story surfaces—another friend tells me something I didn’t
know, another act of kindness reveals itself. How do you write
about someone who has lived so fully, who has given so freely? I
don’t think you can. Not completely. All I can do is collect these
moments, these stories, these fragments of a life well-lived,
and hope that together they form a picture—not perfect, not
complete, but true. Because my father is not a saint. He’s not
perfect. He gets tired. He gets frustrated. He makes mistakes.
But he tries. Every single day. He wakes up and asks: What
can I give today? And that question—asked daily, answered
consistently—has shaped a life of extraordinary impact.
Gratitude is not a feeling. It’s a practice.
We often think of gratitude as something we experience—a
warm sensation when something good happens. But that’s
not gratitude. That’s pleasure. Real gratitude is choosing
to remember. To acknowledge. To honor the people who
showed up for you when they didn’t have to. My father practices
gratitude constantly. Not through words—he’s not effusive or
sentimental. But through action.
Someone helped him once? He remembers. And when he
gets the chance, he helps someone else. That’s how goodness
spreads.

Not through grand gestures, but through small,
119

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

repeated acts of reciprocity.
You help me. I help someone else. They help another. And
slowly, quietly, the world becomes a little bit better. That’s not
naive idealism. That’s how communities survive.
My father understood this instinctively. And he built his life
around it.
***

“Friendship, real friendship, is not measured in dinners
shared or holidays spent together. It is measured in the
moments that test you: the 1 AM phone call you answer
without hesitation, the hospital bed you sit beside when
everyone else has gone home, the money you give without
a contract because you know—you simply know—that
this person would do the same for you.”
“People fooled him. They took advantage of his kindness.
They lied to his face and stole his money. And when I asked
him why he kept giving, he said something I will never
forget: what they do with my help is their responsibility.
What I do with my heart is mine. That is not naivety. That
is the deepest wisdom I have ever encountered.”
“You help me. I help someone else. They help another.
And slowly, quietly, without anyone writing headlines or
giving awards, the world becomes a little bit better. That

120

THE MIRROR OF TIME

is how goodness spreads—not through revolutions, but
through repetition. Through the stubborn, unglamorous
insistence on doing the right thing, again and again, even
when no one is watching.”
“During COVID, when the world locked its doors and
families starved in silence, my father packed rice and
lentils into boxes and went door to door. No government
program. No NGO. Just a retired man with a pension and
a belief that hunger is everyone’s responsibility.”

121

In the Light of Stillness

P

eace doesn’t arrive suddenly—it grows quietly, like
dawn after a long night.
We imagine peace as a destination. A place we’ll reach

once we’ve resolved all our problems, achieved all our goals,
ﬁnally “made it.” But that’s not how peace works.
Peace is not the absence of struggle. It’s the acceptance of it. It’s
the quiet understanding that life will always have challenges,
losses, disappointments—and that’s okay. Some people chase

122

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

peace their entire lives and never ﬁnd it, because they’re looking
in the wrong places. They think it’s in wealth, in success, in
recognition, in control.
But my father found peace in letting go. In accepting what he
could not change. In focusing not on what he lost, but on what
he still had to give. His later years were not about accumulation.
They were about continuation. Continuing to serve. Continuing
to give. Continuing to show up.
And in that continuation, he found something rare: contentment. This is the story of those years. The quiet ones. The ones
where the noise faded and what remained was only what truly
mattered.

Retirement: The Final Gift
As I write these words, my father is preparing to retire. Next
month, after more than thirty-ﬁve years of service with the
Indian Meteorological Department, he will receive his pension,
his retirement honors, and his official exit from government
employment.
This book is my gift to him—my acknowledgment, my attempt
to say what I’ve never been able to say out loud: Thank you. For
everything. Most people, when they retire, exhale. Finally, they
think. Finally, I can rest. Finally, I can focus on myself. But
my father? He won’t rest. He’ll just shift. He’ll no longer wake
at 6 AM to go to the office, but he’ll still wake at 4 AM to feed
the animals. He’ll no longer handle office work, but he’ll still
123

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

manage the temple. He’ll no longer draw a salary, but he’ll still
ﬁnd ways to give. Because for him, work was never a burden.
Service was never exhausting. Giving was never a sacriﬁce.
It was simply who he is—and retirement won’t change that.
It will just give him more time to be who he’s always been: a
man who shows up, who cares, who gives without asking for
anything in return. When people ask him, “Aren’t you tired?
Don’t you want to relax?” he smiles and says, “Relax from
what? I’m doing what I love.” And he means it. This is the
truth about men like my father: they don’t retire from who
they are. They retire from jobs, from offices, from salaries.
But they never retire from service. They never retire from
love. And if you know a man like this—a father, a husband,
a friend—you know exactly what I mean. Because these men
are everywhere. In every family. In every community. They
are the quiet foundations on which everything is built. And we
rarely thank them until it’s almost too late.
This book is my way of honoring that—of saying: I see you. I
honor you. I thank you. Before it’s too late. Before the moment
passes. Before I lose the chance to tell him what he means to me.
Because fathers like mine don’t ask for recognition. They don’t
expect acknowledgment. They just give—day after day, year
after year—until one day they retire, and we realize we never
properly said thank you. This book is my thank you.
Me and my brother both moved away after college. Jobs took
us to different cities. Lives took us to different paths. We
visited when we could—holidays, long weekends, occasional
vacations—but we were no longer home. And my father, who
124

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

had spent decades waking us, feeding us, dropping us to school,
waiting for us, worrying about us, was suddenly in an empty
house. Just him and my mother. I used to worry about this, used
to call and ask, “Are you okay? Are you lonely?” And he would
always say the same thing: “I’m ﬁne. You focus on your life.
We’re proud of you.”
But I wondered. Did he miss us? Did he feel abandoned? Years
later, I asked him directly.
“Papa, when we left, did it hurt?”
He paused, considering. Then he said, “Of course I missed you.
But that’s what sons do. They leave. They build their own lives.
If you had stayed just for me, I would have failed as a father.”
“How so?”
“Because my job,” he said, “was to prepare you to leave. To
give you roots strong enough to grow anywhere. If you stayed
because you felt obligated, that would mean I didn’t do my job.”
That answer—so simple, so clear—explained everything.
He didn’t want us tethered to him. He wanted us free. And our
freedom was his success. I think about that now, as a father
myself, and I realize: this is the paradox of parenthood. You
spend decades building a bond, and then you spend the rest of
your life letting go. You give everything so your children can
leave. And if they do leave—if they build lives of their own, far
away, in cities you’ve never seen—that is not failure. That is the
125

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

greatest success a parent can achieve. Every father understands
this, even if he never says it aloud.
In 2020, I got married. In 2022, my brother got married. And
slowly, a new chapter began: grandchildren. But before the
grandchildren came, there were the pregnancies. And those
pregnancies revealed something about my father that I had
always known but never fully understood: his capacity to love
extends beyond blood, beyond obligation, beyond anything I
could have imagined.

The Next Generation
When my wife Naincy became pregnant in 2023, we were living
in Bengaluru. I had a demanding job, deadlines that never
ended, responsibilities that consumed my days. And then, three
months into the pregnancy, the doctor delivered news that
shattered our peace.
“The amniotic ﬂuid is dangerously low,” the doctor said, his
face grave. “There’s a high risk of preterm delivery. You need to
be prepared for a difficult journey ahead.” My wife’s pregnancy
became a battle. Daily injections. Constant monitoring. Unbearable pain that started from the very beginning and never seemed
to ease. Every day was a question mark. Every appointment
brought new fears.
We decided to move to Lucknow. To be closer to family. To have
support. To give our baby the best chance possible. And that’s
when I saw my father in a way I had never seen him before.

126

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

Because in that moment, I understood: this is what fathers do.
They see burden, and they lift it. They see struggle, and they
ease it. They see their children drowning in responsibility, and
they step in without being asked.
My wife noticed too. She would tell me, “Your father handled
everything again. I didn’t even ask. He just saw what needed
doing and did it.”
And then she would cry. Not from sadness, but from gratitude.
From the overwhelming realization that she was loved, that she
was seen, that she was cared for.
“Only God can take so much,” she whispered to me one night.
“Only God can give so much without asking for anything in
return.”
She was right.
When my brother Avinash’s wife Mahima became pregnant,
my brother was away for work. He couldn’t be there for the
appointments, the checkups, the moments when she needed
support.
So my father stepped in. Every appointment, he was there. Every checkup, he accompanied her. Every moment of uncertainty,
he provided stability.
He would drive her to the hospital, sit in waiting rooms, listen
to doctors’ reports, ask questions she was too nervous to ask.
He would hold her hand when she was scared, reassure her
127

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

when she was worried, celebrate with her when news was good.
And he did it all without my brother asking. Without anyone
expecting it. Without making her feel like she was a burden.
He just showed up. Because that’s who he is. When my brother
returned and learned what my father had done, he tried to thank
him.
“Papa, you didn’t have to do all this. I’m sorry I wasn’t here.”
My father looked at him, surprised. “She’s family. Of course I
had to be here. What else would I do?”
That simple answer—What else would I do?—captures everything about my father.
He doesn’t see helping as optional. He doesn’t see service as
extraordinary. He sees it as obvious. As natural. As the only way
to live. In January 2024, my daughter was born. Preterm, as the
doctors had warned, but healthy. Strong. Beautiful.
And my father? He was there. In the emergency room. Holding
my hand.

Supporting my wife.

Taking care of expenses.

Handling all the ad-hoc work that comes with a new baby. He
didn’t wait to be asked. He didn’t wait for permission. He just
stepped in and did what needed to be done.
And then, in October 2024, my brother’s daughter was born.
Again, preterm. Again, my father was there. Again, he handled
everything—expenses, arrangements, support.
Two daughters. Two miracles. Two moments when life could
128

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

have gone wrong but didn’t. And through it all, my father was
the constant—the steady presence, the silent strength that held
everything together. When my daughter was born, he held her
with a tenderness I had never seen before, speaking to her in
soft tones—not the ﬁrm, instructive voice he used with us, but
something gentler. “She’s so small,” he whispered, cradling
her. “So fragile.” My mother watched him, smiling. “You were
the same with your sons.” “Was I?” he said, surprised. “You
were,” she conﬁrmed. “You’ve just forgotten.”
But I hadn’t forgotten. I remembered how he held us, how he
cared for us, how he did everything—getting us ready, feeding
us, managing every household chore, protecting us—without
ever making us feel like we were burdens. And now, watching
him with my daughter, I understood: he was doing it again.
The same love. The same care. The same silent strength—just
for a new generation. He visits us when he can, and when he
does, he doesn’t lecture or instruct. He just plays. Laughs. Tells
stories. Becomes, for a few days, not the silent strength but
the gentle grandfather. It’s beautiful to watch—this man who
carried so much weight for so long, ﬁnally allowing himself
to simply enjoy. But even in that enjoyment, he’s still serving.
Still helping. Still giving.
Because that’s who he is. That’s who he’ll always be. And I
suspect, if you think about your own father—really think, past
the arguments and the silences and the things left unsaid—
you’ll ﬁnd someone like him too. Someone who showed up
when it mattered. Someone who gave more than he took. Someone who loved you in a language you’re only now beginning to
understand.
129

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

The Freedom

One tradition my father developed over the years: on birthdays
and anniversaries, he doesn’t give gifts—he frees birds. Every
year, on me and my brother’s birthdays, on his grandchildren’s
birthdays, on his wedding anniversary, he goes to the market,
buys 100 to 200 small birds kept in cages, and sets them free.
He believes that freeing a living creature is the highest form of
celebration, that joy should be shared, not hoarded.
The ﬁrst time my wife saw this, she was stunned.
We were celebrating her birthday. She expected cake, maybe a
small gathering. Instead, my father arrived with cages full of
sparrows.

130

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

“Come,” he said, handing her a cage. “Open it.” She looked at
me, confused. I nodded. She opened the cage door. The birds
hesitated for a moment. Then, one by one, they ﬂew out—into
the sky, into freedom. My wife watched them disappear into
the distance, and tears ﬁlled her eyes.
“That’s the most beautiful gift I’ve ever received,” she said. My
father smiled. “They’ll remember this day. And so will you.”
He was right. She talks about it still.

The Peace He Radiates
There’s a quality my father has now—something he didn’t have
when he was younger. It’s hard to describe. Not happiness,
exactly. Not excitement. Not even contentment, though that’s
close.
It’s peace.
He moves through life without urgency.

Without anxiety.

Without the need to prove anything to anyone. He knows who
he is. He knows what he’s done. And he’s at peace with both.
When problems arise, he doesn’t panic. When people criticize,
he doesn’t defend. When opportunities pass, he doesn’t regret.
He simply accepts. And moves forward.
I asked him once, “How do you stay so calm? Doesn’t anything
bother you?”
He thought for a moment. Then he said, “Everything bothers
131

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

me. But I’ve learned that most things are not worth carrying.”
“What do you mean?”
“Anger, resentment, regret—they’re heavy. If you carry
them, you can’t carry anything else. So I put them down.”
“How?”
He smiled. “Practice.”
My father doesn’t talk about legacy. He doesn’t think in those
terms. But he’s building one anyway. Every animal he’s fed.
Every person he’s helped. Every blanket he’s distributed. Every
bird he’s freed. Those actions ripple outward. They touch
lives. They inspire others. They create a standard of decency
that others strive to meet. And beyond the actions, there’s the
example.
My brother and I watched him our entire lives. We saw how he
treated people. How he gave without expecting. How he worked
without complaining. How he loved without condition.
And we learned.
Not through lectures. Not through rules. But through observation.
We learned that a good life is not measured in wealth, but in
impact.
We learned that strength is quiet.
We learned that service is its own reward.
And now, we’re trying to live those lessons.

Imperfectly.

Incompletely. But sincerely. That’s legacy. Not monuments
or wealth or fame. But values passed down. Lessons absorbed.
132

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

Examples followed. It’s 5:03 AM. The sky outside is beginning
to lighten. Dawn is approaching.
I’ve been writing all night. And I realize: I’ve been trying to
capture something that can’t be captured. My father is not a
character. He’s not a story. He’s a life—complex, multifaceted,
impossible to reduce to words.
But I’m trying anyway. Because I want my children to know
him. I want my grandchildren to know him. I want strangers
who never met him to understand: this is what goodness looks
like.
Not perfect. Not ﬂawless. But sincere. He didn’t change
the world. He didn’t cure diseases or end wars or invent
technologies. He just lived well. Day after day. Year after year.
And in doing so, he changed the only world that really mattered:
ours.
Aging is not about decline. It’s about distillation.
As we grow older, the noise fades. The things that once seemed
important—status, possessions, appearances—lose their grip.
And what remains is only what’s real.
Relationships. Memories. Values. Peace.
My father has reached that place. The place where nothing is
urgent, but everything matters.
He doesn’t rush anymore. But he never stops.

133

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

He doesn’t worry anymore. But he never stops caring.
He doesn’t strive anymore. But he never stops giving.
That’s the gift of age, when it’s lived right: clarity. The ability
to see what actually matters. And the wisdom to focus only on
that. Not everyone reaches this place. Some people age into
bitterness, into regret, into clinging to what’s gone.
But my father aged into peace. And watching him, I understand:
that’s what I want. Not wealth. Not fame. Not even longevity.
Just peace. The quiet knowledge that I lived well. That I gave
freely. That I left things better than I found them.
That’s the inheritance I want to claim.
***

“If you had stayed just for me, he said, I would have
failed as a father. My job was to prepare you to leave—to
give you roots strong enough to grow anywhere. That
answer broke something in me and healed something too.
Because I realized: his greatest success was our freedom.
And our freedom was his greatest sacrifice.”
“He broke all his fixed deposits near retirement to help
me buy a home. When I protested, he said: I have God’s
blessings. I have love. I have my family. What else do I

134

IN THE LIGHT OF STILLNESS

need? At seventy years old, with nothing left in the bank,
he believed—truly believed—that love was enough. And
watching him, I think he might be right.”
“Aging is not about decline. It is about distillation—the
slow, graceful process of letting go of everything that
doesn’t matter until all that remains is what was always
true: that you loved well, that you gave freely, that you
left the world a little better than you found it. My father
has reached that place. And it is the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.”
“He took over every household chore during my wife’s
pregnancy without being asked. He cooked for the family
when she was unwell. He brought blueberries from across
the city because he remembered she liked them. This is
what fathers do in their later years: they circle back. They
become, once more, the caregivers they were when their
children were small. And in doing so, they prove that love
does not diminish with age. It deepens.”

137

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

quiet moment when we look back and ask: What did I actually do
with my time here? Some people look back and see possessions.
Houses. Cars. Investments. Things accumulated, stored,
protected. Others see accomplishments. Degrees. Promotions.
Titles. Milestones achieved, boxes checked, goals met.
And still others see something different. Not things or achievements, but impact. Lives touched. Moments shared. Values
passed down. My father will look back—years from now,
when his time comes—and see a different kind of wealth.
He’ll see the animals that didn’t go hungry. The people who
received help when they needed it most. The sons who were
given opportunities he never had. The community that was
strengthened by his service.
He’ll see a life of purpose. Not fame. Not recognition. But
meaning. And that, ultimately, is all any of us can hope for.
This is the ﬁnal chapter. The one about what remains when
everything else is stripped away.

The Values He Never Spoke
My father never sat us down for lectures about values. He never
said, “Here’s how you should live. Here’s what matters.” He
just lived. And we watched.
We watched him wake before dawn to feed animals no one
else cared about.
We watched him give money to people who sometimes lied to
him.
We watched him work two jobs so we could go to better
138

WHAT REMAINS

schools.
We watched him accept insults without retaliating.
We watched him stay calm when others panicked.
And from watching, we learned.
Work without complaint. He never said those words. But we
saw him work seventeen-hour days without once suggesting it
was too much.
Give without expectation. He never preached generosity. But
we saw him help people who couldn’t repay him, and never
mention it again.
Stay humble in success. He never warned us about pride. But we
saw him achieve things—jobs, respect, leadership—and remain
exactly the same: gentle, unassuming, kind.
Serve without recognition. He never told us service was noble.
But we saw him do it every day, in ways large and small, never
posting about it, never seeking applause. These values weren’t
taught. They were inherited. Through osmosis. Through years
of proximity to a man who simply lived them.
A few months ago, I sat with my father on the terrace of our
home. It was evening. The sky was orange and pink, the air
cooling. I had a notebook with me. I told him I was writing this
book.
“I need to ask you some questions,” I said. “So I get the details
right.”
139

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

He nodded, amused. “Ask.”
“Do you have any regrets?”
He thought for a long time. Then: “No. I did what I could with
what I had. That’s all anyone can do.”
“If you could go back, would you change anything?”
Another pause. “Maybe I would have spent more time with you
and your brother when you were young. But I was working. I
thought providing was the same as presence. I’ve learned it’s
not.”
I felt my throat tighten. “We never felt you weren’t present,
Papa.”
He smiled. “That’s kind of you to say.”
“What do you want people to remember about you?”
He laughed softly. “I don’t think about that. People will
remember what they remember. I can’t control it.”
“But if you could choose?”
He looked at me directly. “I’d want them to remember that
I tried. That I wasn’t perfect, but I tried.” That answer—so
simple, so honest—captures everything about him. He’s not
seeking sainthood. He’s not claiming perfection. Just effort.
Sincere, consistent effort.
140

WHAT REMAINS

And that’s enough. Not wealth. Not status. But continuity. The
passing of values from one generation to the next.

The Final Sacrifice: Everything He Had Left
In mid-2025, I decided to buy a home in Bengaluru. A proper
house. A place where my wife and daughter could grow roots,
where we could build a life, where we could ﬁnally feel settled.
But homes in Bengaluru are expensive. Even with my salary,
even with savings, the down payment was substantial. More
than I had. More than I could manage alone.
I didn’t ask my father for help. I didn’t even mention the
struggle. I just tried to ﬁgure it out, to make it work, to ﬁnd a
way. But my father noticed. He always notices.
He saw the stress. He saw the calculations. He saw me trying to
make numbers work that wouldn’t work. And then, one day, he
called me.
“I want to help,” he said simply.
“Papa, no. You’re retiring next month. You need that money.
You need your savings.”
“I have enough,” he said. “I have my pension. I have my home.
I have everything I need.”
“But—”
“Son,” he interrupted gently, “this is what I’ve been saving for.
141

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Not for myself. For you. For your future. For your daughter’s
future.”
And then he did something that broke me. He broke all his ﬁxed
deposits. Every single one. Money he had saved over decades.
Money meant for emergencies. Money that was his security,
his safety net, his peace of mind. He gave it all to me. Without
being asked. Without hesitation. Without condition.
Even at the edge of retirement, with no job security ahead, with
only a pension to rely on, he gave me everything he had. When
I received the money, I called him, my voice shaking.
“Papa, I can’t take this. You’re retiring. You need this.”
“I have God’s blessings,” he said quietly. “I have love. I have
my family. What else do I need?”
That answer—What else do I need?—shattered me.
Because in that moment, I understood: this is what true fathers
do. They don’t measure love in what they keep. They measure it
in what they give away. My father, at seventy, near retirement,
with no guarantee of what comes next, gave me everything he
had saved over a lifetime. Not because he had to. Not because I
asked. Because that’s who he is. That’s what love looks like to
him.
And I realized: this is the pattern of his entire life. Giving.
Always giving. To animals. To strangers. To his family. To
anyone who needs help.
142

WHAT REMAINS

He gives until there’s nothing left. And then he gives his faith,
his love, his blessings. Because those, he believes, are enough.
This is what a true father is. Not someone who accumulates
wealth to pass down. But someone who gives everything he has,
every time, without hesitation, without regret.
This is the silent strength. This is my father. And I hope, one
day, I can be even half the father he is. It’s easy to forget, in the
comfort of my current life, where I came from.
I live in a nice home now. In Bengaluru. A home my father
helped me buy with everything he had saved. I have a stable
job. My daughter goes to a good school. My wife and I travel
occasionally. We eat out. We have savings.
None of this feels extraordinary. It’s just… normal. But it’s not
normal. Not compared to where my father started.
He grew up in a village with no electricity, no running water, no
education beyond the basics. He worked from the time he was
ten years old. He survived accidents that should have killed him.
He cycled through darkness for years, delivering newspapers,
earning pennies.
And from that beginning, he built a life stable enough that his
sons never had to struggle the way he did. We got to focus
on studies. We got to dream without limits. We got to choose
careers based on interest, not survival. We got to buy homes,
build lives, create futures. That freedom—that luxury—exists
because he carried the weight. Because he gave everything he
143

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

had, every time, without asking for anything in return. And I
forget that sometimes. I take it for granted.
But writing this book has been a reminder. A reckoning. A return
to gratitude. Because my father, at seventy, near retirement,
broke all his ﬁxed deposits to help me buy a home. And he did it
with a smile. With peace. With the absolute conviction that this
was right.
Because that’s who he is. That’s what fathers do. They give
until there’s nothing left. And then they give their love, their
faith, their blessings.
And they believe—they truly believe—that’s enough. People
ask me sometimes: “What’s your father’s legacy?”
And I used to struggle with that question. Because legacy implies
something big. Something public. Something that endures
beyond a lifetime. My father didn’t build monuments. He didn’t
found institutions. He didn’t write books or create art or lead
movements.
So what’s his legacy? And then I realized: it’s us.
Me. My brother. Our children. The values we carry. The way we
treat people. The choices we make.
That’s his legacy.
He built people. Not structures.

144

WHAT REMAINS

He shaped lives. Not outcomes.
He passed down something more valuable than money: a
template for how to live. And if we pass that down to our
children, and they pass it to theirs, then my father’s legacy
doesn’t end. It multiplies. That’s immortality. Not fame. Not
monuments. But values that echo through generations.
It’s 5:47 AM. The sun is rising. I’ve been writing all night. And I
realize: I’m not writing this book for readers. Not really. I’m
writing it for me. To process. To understand. To honor.
My father doesn’t need this book. He doesn’t seek recognition.
He won’t read it and feel validated. But I needed to write it.
Because for thirty-three years, I’ve taken him for granted. I’ve
assumed he’d always be there. Always steady. Always strong.
And now, as I grow older, as I become a father myself, I’m
beginning to understand: he won’t always be here.
One day—maybe soon, maybe decades from now—he’ll be gone.
And when that day comes, I want to have done this. I want to
have captured, however imperfectly, what he meant. Not just
to me. But to everyone whose life he touched.
This book is my attempt to say what I’ve never quite been able
to say out loud:
Thank you. Thank you for the sacriﬁces I didn’t see. Thank you
for the love I took for granted. Thank you for building a life I
could thrive in. Thank you for being the silent strength that
145

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

held everything together. I hope I can be even half the father
you were. I hope my children look at me the way I look at you. I
hope, when my time comes, I can say what you said: I have no
regrets. I did my best. That’s all any of us can hope for. And if
you’re reading this—if you have a father, a mother, a person
who carried you—call them. Tell them. Don’t wait for a book.
Don’t wait for a perfect moment. The perfect moment is now.
Every child, eventually, realizes their parents are human—
ﬂawed, imperfect, tired, uncertain. And for some, that realization is devastating; the pedestal crumbles, and the hero
becomes ordinary. But for others—if they’re lucky—the realization deepens respect. Because being human and still showing
up every day is harder than being perfect. Struggling with
doubt and still choosing kindness is braver than never doubting.
Carrying exhaustion and still serving others is stronger than
never feeling tired.
My father is human. He gets frustrated. He gets tired. He has
limits. But he tries—every single day, despite the exhaustion,
despite the frustration, despite the limits. And that’s what
makes him extraordinary. Not his perfection. His persistence.
This is the story of every father, every husband, every son who
ever woke before dawn and chose duty over comfort, service
over sleep, family over self. They are not saints. They are
something better: they are human beings who chose, again
and again, to be good. And that choice, made daily, made
consistently, made without recognition—that is the silent
strength. It lives in my father. It lives in yours. It lives in every
home where someone carries more than their share and never
asks for credit.
146

WHAT REMAINS

***

“What do you want people to remember about you?
I asked him. He laughed softly and said: I’d want
them to remember that I tried. That I wasn’t perfect,
but I tried. And in that answer I heard the echo
of every father, every husband, every son who ever
carried more than his share and asked for less than he
deserved. They don’t want monuments. They don’t
want awards. They just want to know that someone
noticed. That someone saw.”
“He built people, not structures. He shaped lives, not
outcomes. He passed down not wealth but values, not
property but principles, not inheritance but integrity.
And those things—unlike land, unlike money, unlike
anything you can hold in your hands—never lose their
value. They only grow.”
“A life of meaning is not built in grand moments—not
in promotions or weddings or awards. It is built in
the unremarkable hours: the 4 AM walk to feed strays,
the dishes washed when no one was looking, the ﬁxed
deposits broken for a son’s dream, the letters written
at midnight that say only this: I love you. Continue
feeding the animals. Don’t let them down.”
“Not his perfection. His persistence. That is what

147

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

makes him extraordinary. Because perfection is the
domain of saints—and my father is no saint. He
is something better. He is human. Flawed, tired,
uncertain. And still, every single day, he chooses
kindness.”

148

Conclusion

I

f you’ve read this far, thank you. Thank you for spending
time with my father’s story, for honoring a life that
might have otherwise gone unnoticed, for recognizing

that ordinary people can live extraordinary lives. I hope this
book inspires you—not to be like my father, because he’s unique
and unrepeatable, but to ﬁnd your own version of strength, your
own way of serving, your own form of giving, your own silent
strength.
Because the world doesn’t need more famous people. It needs
more good people. People who show up. People who care.
People who give without expecting. People who carry burdens
without complaint. People who handle every chore without
hesitation, who feed animals no one else cares about, who
break their ﬁxed deposits to help their children, who show up
in emergency rooms and handle expenses and do everything
that needs to be done, silently, consistently, without asking for
anything in return.
People like my father. And maybe—just maybe—people like
you. Because the silent strength exists everywhere. In your
home. In your family. In the people who love you without
149

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

condition. You just have to look for it. You just have to see
it. And then, most importantly, you have to honor it—while
you still can, before it’s too late, before the moment passes and
you’re left with only regret.
This book is my attempt to honor my father before he retires,
before it’s too late. I hope it inspires you to do the same—to see
the silent strength in your own life, to honor it, to become it.
Because that’s how the world changes. Not through revolutions.
Through generations. One quiet act of love at a time.

Epilogue

It’s 6:00 AM now.
Outside my window, the city is waking. I can hear the ﬁrst
sounds of morning—birds, distant traffic, the hum of life
beginning again. And somewhere, thousands of miles away,
my father is also awake. He’s ﬁnishing his morning rounds.
The animals have been fed. The streets are quiet again. He’s
walking home, his cloth bags empty, his heart full.
He’ll return home, wash his hands, complete his prayers. My

151

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

mother will have prepared breakfast. They’ll sit together in
comfortable silence, eating, reading the newspaper, starting
another day.
And later, he’ll call me. He always does. Just to check in. Just to
ask how I’m doing, how my daughter is, whether everything is
okay.
And I’ll say, “Everything’s ﬁne, Papa. How are you?”
And he’ll say, “I’m good. Everything is good.”
And that will be the conversation. Short. Simple. Unremarkable.
But beneath those words, there’s a lifetime. Decades of sacriﬁce.
Years of service. Thousands of small, unnoticed acts of love.
This book is my attempt to make visible what has always been
invisible.
To honor the silent strength.
On the cover of this book, there’s a photograph. An Indian
man, older now, gray hair, weathered face, simple clothes,
gentle eyes. To a stranger, he looks ordinary—unremarkable,
forgettable, just another face in a crowd. But to me, to my
brother, to my mother, to the countless animals he’s fed, to
the people he’s helped, he is everything. He is proof that a
good life doesn’t require fame, that strength doesn’t need to
be loud, that service is its own reward. He is the man who fed
stray animals for thirty-two years without missing a single day,
152

EPILOGUE

who worked two jobs so his sons could go to college, who gave
blood at 1 AM for a friend’s relative, who distributed blankets in
winter to strangers, who ran a tea stall in a canteen with dignity,
who bet everything on his children’s future and never regretted
it, who broke all his ﬁxed deposits near retirement to help his
son buy a home, who handled every household chore during his
daughters-in-law’s difficult pregnancies without hesitation or
complaint, who showed up in emergency rooms and handled
expenses and did everything that needed to be done, silently,
consistently, without complaint.
He is my father. And he is every father who carries burdens
silently, every mother who sacriﬁces without recognition, every
parent who chooses their children’s future over their own
comfort. This book is for him—my acknowledgment, my thank
you, my attempt to honor him before he retires, before it’s too
late. But it’s also for you, because somewhere in these pages,
you’ll see your own father, your own mother, your own story.
The details will differ. The names will change. But the essence
remains the same: love, sacriﬁce, service, strength. These are
not unique to my father. They are universal. They exist in every
home where someone wakes before dawn to provide, in every
family where someone works in silence so others can thrive, in
every life where someone gives more than they take, in every
moment where someone chooses kindness over convenience,
service over comfort, giving over keeping.
I’m thirty-three years old, a father myself now, and I’m still
learning how to be like my father. I want to be patient like
him, but I get frustrated. I want to be generous like him, but
I calculate. I want to serve like him, but I get tired. I want to
153

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

give without expectation, to help without being asked, to love
without condition—but I’m human, and humans are ﬂawed,
and I fall short every single day.
I’m not there yet. Maybe I never will be. But I’m trying.
And maybe that’s the point—not perfection, but effort. Not
sainthood, but sincerity. My father didn’t become who he
is overnight. It took decades. Thousands of small choices.
Consistent effort. Day after day, year after year, choosing
kindness over convenience, service over comfort, giving over
taking, until those choices became who he was, until they
became as natural as breathing.
And if I keep trying—if I keep choosing the harder path, the
selﬂess path, the path of service—maybe, eventually, I’ll get
closer. Not to perfection. Just to sincerity. Just to being someone
who tries, who shows up, who gives what he can, who loves
without condition. That’s all he ever asked for. That’s all any
father asks for: that we try. That we honor the values they
passed down. That we become, in our own way, the kind of
people they raised us to be.
If you’ve read this far, thank you. Thank you for spending
time with my father’s story, for honoring a life that might have
otherwise gone unnoticed, for recognizing that ordinary people
can live extraordinary lives. I hope this book inspires you—not
to be like my father, because he’s unique and unrepeatable, but
to ﬁnd your own version of strength, your own way of serving,
your own form of giving, your own silent strength.
Because the world doesn’t need more famous people. It needs
154

EPILOGUE

more good people. People who show up. People who care.
People who give without expecting. People who carry burdens
without complaint. People who handle every chore without
hesitation, who feed animals no one else cares about, who
break their ﬁxed deposits to help their children, who show up
in emergency rooms and handle expenses and do everything
that needs to be done, silently, consistently, without asking for
anything in return.
People like my father. And maybe—just maybe—people like
you. Because the silent strength exists everywhere. In your
home. In your family. In the people who love you without
condition. You just have to look for it. You just have to see
it. And then, most importantly, you have to honor it—while
you still can, before it’s too late, before the moment passes and
you’re left with only regret.
This book is my attempt to honor my father before he retires,
before it’s too late. I hope it inspires you to do the same—to see
the silent strength in your own life, to honor it, to become it.
Because that’s how the world changes. Not through revolutions.
Through generations. One quiet act of love at a time.
Before I end this book, one last story.
A few weeks ago, I was visiting my parents. Early morning. I
couldn’t sleep, so I went for a walk. And I saw him.
My father. Walking down the street. Cloth bags in hand.
Stopping at corners. Feeding animals. I followed at a distance,
watching.
155

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

There was an old dog—thin, limping, clearly sick. Most people
would have walked past it. But my father knelt down. He broke
off extra pieces of bread. He placed them gently in front of the
dog. He waited until the dog ﬁnished eating.
And then—this is the part that broke me—he placed his hand
on the dog’s head. Just for a moment. A gesture of blessing. Of
acknowledgment.
You matter. You’re seen. You’re loved.
And then he stood and continued walking.
I stood there, watching him disappear down the street. And I
thought:
That’s him. That’s who he is.
Not the government employee. Not the father who sent us to
college. Not the temple president.
Just a man. Kneeling in the street. Feeding a sick dog. With no
one watching.
Except me.
And now, you.
This is the silent strength.
Not loud. Not grand. Not celebrated.
156

EPILOGUE

Just present. Consistent. Real.
It’s in the early mornings no one sees.
It’s in the sacriﬁces no one knows about.
It’s in the love that doesn’t need to announce itself.
It’s in my father. And it’s in yours too, if you look closely. Look
for it. Honor it. Carry it forward. Because that’s how the world
changes.
Not through revolutions. Through generations.
One quiet act of love at a time.
